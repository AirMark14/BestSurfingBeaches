ITRT;Watch Those Swells and Waves (Ehukai));Banzai Pipeline, one of the best-known areas on the North Shore, is noted for barreling waves and swells.  The Pipeline has two personalities so to speak. During the summer, the area is calm and is an ideal spot for swimming, snorkeling and relaxing on the beach.  However, during the winter months its waves are enormous and dangerous for the novice surfer. The waves sometimes reach 30 feet.  Several professional surfing competitions are held here in the winter months. We visited the end of March but did not see any huge swells.  The pipeline is the “Holy Grail” of riding the waves.  One of the waves is featured at the beginning of the Hawaii-Five-O television program. Surfing here is ot for the amateur so leave it to the professionals. Many surfers have lost their lives or suffered injuries when attempting to ride the pipeline waves.;4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r838887311-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Nostalgiyeah;Wonderful beach - a surfer's dreamland!;Banzai Pipeline is a surfer's paradise! The waves are huge, and they are known to attract surfers from all over. It is an incredible experience to sit on the beach and watch the pool of adept surfers riding enormous waves one after the other. The beach is reasonably crowded, although I'd say it is less so compared to a lot of other beaches on the island of Oahu. I found the beach to be very clean and the waters to be abundantly clear. It was a great sight to watch the sunset at this beach. One could sit here for hours on and watch the waves and the surfers! It was a little tough to find parking when we got here on a weekend evening, a little bit before sunset - so be prepared to drive a little in order to find a parking spot.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r780400535-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

al22tecc;Great view, surf, beach.;"We visited this right after new year's, although 2 weeks prior we were also at the north shore, the waves were as high.  The waves between these two visits were better, but for January 2,the waves were forecasted to be around 25 feet, lower than the 35 feet between Dec 27 and January 1.  It was still an impressive 25 feet, as the surfers were going for it, and the cameras on tripods were plenty.

The beach is also quite wide, as we went with the tide at around 1.2M high.  But because the waves were over 25 feet, the life guards on jetskis were busy.  Aside from watching over the surfers, they had to occasionally go along the beach line to call the attention of some beach goers.

We were able to park at the parking lot at the school across, although there were cars parked at the parking lot in front of the beach, and/or the roadside. Traffic was heavy, but moving.

I was able to access a local tide forecast at the TA forums for Oahu which provided the wave status, a must if you want to be impressed with the waves.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r740166387-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Kawikamf;Fabulous!;"Banzai Pipeline is less than a mile from my house. During the Winter, Pipeline breaks out the best surf in the world.  The waves are not big at the Pipe (about 10 feet, but can get to about 20 feet).  BUT it is probably the most dangerous, because the waves break in shallow waters, where if one falls of the board in the wrong way, then you will meet your maker (by slamming into the shallow reefs). I have lost two good friends at the Pipe, when it was breaking; and they were relatively good surfers.  So, enjoy the surfers, but do not attempt, unless you are a good surfer, and know how to fall from your board.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r733930381-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Great drive along the surf beaches on North Shore and can be all most impossible to park, traffic crawls on single lane with people searching for parks. Still great to see some big wave surfing.

I also saw one of the adult surfers being carried out by life guards on a body board. The poor surfer looked to have a back injury.

I’m giving this 4 stars since there is no water access except for the surfers. It is posted against swimming. There is a bath house. Parking is limited. Come before 10 am if you want parking.

chriss552016;Breathtaking Beach;"Definitely a must visit, not just to say you have been to the famous beach but to see it for yourself as it is beautiful & well worth it. When we were there the surf was huge so the surf tournament had to be postponed so unfortunately only saw 1 guy attempt to surf on our last day there. Photos don't do it justice on how high the waves get and the roads were covered in sand from the waves the day before.
Parking is very hard if it is a hot day or when surfing is on, but we went early in the morning & managed to park in the carpark. There were men sweeping & cleaning the sand of the paths & there is mats down for wheelchair access to the beach & restrooms.
Very relaxing sitting watching the waves roll in while sitting on the soft white sand.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r648495234-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
Dave_Kukelko;Waves, Crystal Clear Water, Sand, Sounds and Smell of Hawaii;"We've been to Hawaii many times.  Always find a time to make a few visits and hang-out on pipeline beach.
If you can make pipe masters, hard to explain the experience, the crowd. Its a love in.
Also come several times when no one there, hang out a little more towards the east end with no one.
In the summer can swim. 
In the winter when calmer can still go in and boogie board, watch out for rocks.
No services, but can use public washrooms by the food trucks.
Food trucks great place to end the day and watch the sunset.
The sounds and smell of the ocean, can't wait to be back.";4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r647879235-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

However the day we were there, they were going strong with waves around 20-25 feet.  You should be a strong swimmer if you wish to tackle the beach here as the waves will suck you out in a heartbeat, this is not a place for a novice or kids.  We enjoyed laying back and watching the surfers, its quite impressive.  Parking can be a little tricky but can be found with some persistence.

Despite the rain that fell while we were on the beach, we spent about an hour watching these gigantic and powerful waves.

WorldTravelers34;Notorious for huge waves;Our private tour guide brought us to this area and told us some detailed info about the Banzai Pipeline and the area. Ehukai Beach (Banzai Pipeline) is known for powerful waves that break over a sharp reef no more than a few feet from the surface. These massive tubes make this one of the most dangerous surf spots in the world and one of the venues for the Triple Crown of Surfing. One of the 10 deadliest waves in the world, Hawaii’s Banzai Pipeline is famous for its heavy swells that can reach up to 30ft, breaking over shallow, rocky coral reefs at high speeds to form barreling curls of water. Top professionals take on the waves every November in the “Vans Triple Crown”, called the “Super Bowl of surfing” by The Los Angeles Times.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r571138918-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
Traveling007Texan;The Pipe Masters is Located Here for a Reason;We usually travel to the North Shore of Oahu in December to watch the final leg of the Triple Crown of Surfing - the Pipe Masters located on Pupukea Beach, more commonly known as Banzai Pipeline.  This beach is one of the best on the island to watch surfers up close.  The surf break is only yards off of the beach allowing you to easily take photos of the surfers.  Obiously, during the winter months, only experienced surfers should enter the water.  If you are ever on Oahu during December when the Pipe Masters is occurring, be sure to drive to the North Shore and watch this fabulous event.

It was amazing to watch these top surfers navigate gigantic waves. Only downside, make sure you are wearing enough sunscreen, even stopping on a cloudy day, since the sand is so light, and the waves/water so intense, just standing for an hour or so yielded a sunburned nose!";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r567714431-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
sgs0720;Incredible waves, surfing, and sunsets;"The Banzai Pipeline is an incredible place to watch wave after wave after wave pummel into shore. The beach is wide and sandy with lots of room to sit and be entertained by both the waves and the surfers and body boarders riding them. The Waianae Mountain Range and Kaena Point can be seen to the west, and the sun sets over the ocean near this point, offering spectacular sunset views.

We returned to the Banzai Pipeline each evening during our stay on the North Shore to watch the waves, surfers, and sunset. The waves varied in height each day, but were incredible to see each time. The sunset, too, was amazing with the variations in the clouds and the colors each day. On two occasions, the clouds lit up the sky after the sun had sunk below the horizon, and the ocean reflected the amazing light in the clouds. It was worthwhile to return many times, and our evenings spent here was one of my favorite experiences during our stay on O'ahu.

The Volcom Pipe Pro was on at Pipeline while we were in O'ahu, and we returned to the beach to watch the surf competition four of the five days it ran. The waves provided the surfers many barrels, and we saw four perfect ten point rides throughout the competition. While sitting on the beach, we had an excellent view of the surfers, and the commentators provided knowledge on the area, surfing, and the competition as they announced the wave scores and results for each heat. With the close proximity to the surfers, free admission, beach seating, and seeing athletes from around the world competing, the surf competition was a neat and unique way to see a professional sporting event.

Our time spent on the beach at Pipeline was definitely a highlight of our time on O'ahu, and I highly recommend a stop there if you visit the island.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r567035225-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

dsb62;Bonzai Pipe - Our Favourite Place to go.;"We have actually been there a number of times.  It is one of our favourites places to go on Oahu.  We are not surfers of any stature.  We definitely would not go out at pipe, and nor should most people.  Leave this to the pros.  We are just mother nature enthusiasts who love to watch the power of sea at work.  The raw beauty as the waves rise up to towering heights is incredible and then the thunderous roar rocks the shoreline as it crashes to completion.  I had dreamed about seeing the North Shore since I was a little guy watching Wide World of Sports on Saturday afternoon in rural Saskatchewan.  So this is a dream come true every time we visit.  Last year we had waves that were intense (4 times overhead)and watched as one surfers was pulled unconscious from the sea.  It was incredible to watch how the surfing community pulled together and rushed to this surfers aid.  The jet skis could not get in to pull him out because the intense wave action.   And every time they would have him on the ski he would roll off because he was unconscious.  It was a terrible feeling to be watching from shore but these guys pulled it together and brought this pro back to life.  He now surfs with a helmet as his board knocked him out.    This is a serious location.  If you can surf really really well this place may be for you, but I will tell you as we sit on the beach and watch these surfers rush into the water to paddle out.  They start 2-300 yards down the beach and before they get 100' feet offshore they have passed infront of us as they head out into the competition  The current is scary just to watch it happe.  The waves are random and the force is incredible.  We sit at the high poingt on the beach and everytime we are there we watch people get soaked and loose their belongings as the surge rushes up the beach to the very back.  It is incredible.  Then people chase their rubber sandals as the next wave rushes in.  IT IS NOT WORTH, forget your stuff be safe. 

All around just a beautiful place to enjoy and the sunsets are incredible as well.   Plenty of local food trucks around and you are very close to turtle bay if you want to head a bit further up the coast.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r564978485-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

FunOnly;Go to watch a surfing competition;"The only reason to go to Banzai Beach is to watch a surfing competition. I have been fortunate to see the best in world performing in the “pipeline”.

It is a very dangerous beach for the casual swimmer or surfer as there is a vicious undertow when the surf is up. It is not a place for beginners. Heed the red flags posted by the lifeguards!

Banzai is a very open beach with not much of interest, it is a high crime area so leave any valuables at home and all bags etc locked in the trunk of the car out of sight. There is a parking lot but this fills quickly during competitions, follow the locals for safe roadside parking.

On the last visit in February 2018 the surf was up but the conditions were not right for the waves to form the pipeline. The few surfers there only got a few unspectacular rides.

Bottom line do up to the minute research about conditions at the beach or be disappointed. Rated average unless doing to spectate at a competition";3;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r559688260-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Lots of surfers and if you don’t know what you’re doing, you could get hurt. We watched surfers of all shapes and sizes. Very fun way to soak up some sun.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r559123399-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
SurfChix84;Surf’s Up! Go!;"As a fan of surfing, when I found out the Volcom Pipepro Competition would be ongoing during our trip, I knew we had to spend at least a day on the North Shore. 

Winter in Hawaii brings high surf conditions. We arrived around lunch and easily found great viewing space first row on the beach. The waves were 12-14ft high and plenty of surfers were in the water. 

Winter in Hawaii also brings instable weather conditions. It was sunny and hot most of the day, then out pf the blue, we got caught in a quick storm. Luckily we were ready with rain attire. The sun came back 20 min later. 

We had our own snacks/food, but there are plenty of food trucks onsite if you get hungry. 

I would have gone back for another day had time not been an issue! Lots to do and see on the North Shore; make sure you go! 

Tip: as soon as you start seeing lots of cars on the side of the street, start looking for a spot for your car. It can get hectic especially if an international competition is on.

finesilver;Interesting beach and waves;"I enjoyed seeing this famous location for surfing. I was happy to see the beach and big waves, not as many surfers as some days I am told.  I ended up taking more photos if anything because the location was so great, also great clouds the day I was there.

KelliAnneMcKenna;You can’t visit the North Shore & not stop at Pipeline;Banzai Pipeline is as iconic as it gets.

WillKernos;Tips for competition days;I decided on a trip in december 2017 to see the pipeline masters and thought i'd share a few tips for those going to watch other surfing competitions. The conditons this year were very unpredictable so if your planning to see a final make sure you take the whole week before it and stay local. I stayed in Laie which is abot 15 mins drive to the pipeline and well worth staying in. On the days you want to go be prepared for all weather. It's winter so it can turn at any moment. If you can get there early, I would get there at 6am and you will be driving there with no street lights so take a map or gps. At that time you will find a spot by the side of the road (make sure your not anywhere near a taped off section) Take a packed lunch with you and pleanty of water/coffee and fruit. Then sit back and watch the worlds best surf an amazing surf break and enjoy the croud and atmosphere. Like any beach it can get hot, slip slop slap and enjoy!;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r548306225-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
rorys731;Billabong Pipeline Masters;"Great beach to watch a surf comp. We turned up around 9am and was hard to find a park however a number of places were offering $10 parking near the event.

A couple food trucks nearby with a specialty being Acai Ganola bowl. This was nice.

Surfing was great as the waves were good size and action was close to the beach. About 30min to 40min from Waikiki depending on traffic/day of the week.

Keep updated on the internet in the morning to see if surfing is going ahead.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r548141817-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
StacyMacDonald;A cool place to see some surfing;We may have missed this pull-off, except the Pipe Masters was on and the signage was enormous. The competition wasn't happening when we were watching, but there were still surfers out in the water.

ValerieO315;Very cool spot to stop and watch some unbelievable surfing!;If you are anywhere near this area, this is definitely worth taking an hour or so to stop and take in.  We were there in mid-September and the waves were unbelievable.  The surfers were incredible.  The area you need to walk through on the way to the beach is a little seedy, but safe.  The beach is really gorgeous.  We brought lunch and sat and watched the surfing.  We only planned to take stay for a few minutes, but found ourselves staying much longer because the surfers were so amazing to watch.  You can park for free right across the street at the Sunset Beach school.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r538622563-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
Llewellyn53;We were lucky;"We just happened to be in Waikiki when a ""life threatening"" swell was predicted. We took the bus and yes it took a while but no traffic or driving hassles. When we arrived the beach was taped off and the outer reef had close out sets every 20 odd minutes. The sand beach is really steep and the break is close to shore so i imagine competitions must be spectacular.

Big waves, small waves, no waves ... it's impressive to take in and terrifying to imagine the power of a big swell there.  The history, the stories are too great to miss the chance to pay homage - there is a magnitude of respect we owe the surfers who have the talent to surf there when the swell is big. The North Shore and its surf spots are a great piece of Hawaiian history.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r535942177-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
TimDore;Great for winter surf watching;Pipeline is directly across the street from Sunset Beach Elementary School. It is very easy to drive right by it so just look for the school. This is a must see surf spot in the winter months but during the summer it is very flat. I’ve been here many times and my advice is not to go in the water unless you are a very strong swimmer. I went out on a small day just for a little body surfing and the first wave all but ripped my suit off. The surf here is incredibly powerful so listen to the lifeguards and be smart!;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r533003868-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

tcmoranau;Inspirational;Visited in May 2016. Let me say, I am not a surfer, never have been. I do enjoy the beach, and have watched surf tournaments over thew years. For me, this was a must-do on our trip to Hawaii...and Im not sure why?! But once there, I found the entire place (beach) to be quite cathartic and surreal. As a sports lover, its one of those spots you go to where you have a 'pinch me' moment. I sat there for about an hour just watching the guys surf, taking some great photos of them, and my wife and daughter too haha!. The 7yo did get a little bored of it all, but ended up playing in the sand and water as kids do at the beach. Well worth the drive up and around the island to visit. It showcases the beauty of nature, and the natural environment the surf community reside in and partake of. I was jealous of their lifestyle.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r508617450-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Shaine96;Smooth waves and great memories;We had the pleasure of enjoying pipeline on a calm day without heavy, thunderous waves that this beach is known for. Though it was calm there were still sizable swells that could do some damage if you don't time the waves correctly and avoid being scooped up by them. The water was cool, blue and clear which allowed us to enjoy the beach even more while we were darting underneath waves and bodysurfing the shores. Pipeline is obviously a great place for surfing and seeing professional surfers along with people bogey boarding and just enjoying the water while it's calm. It was a great day and all I can really say is if you see the locals swimming and you're up to it then take a dive in the water while being safe about it.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r469991256-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
