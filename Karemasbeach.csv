John Doe;Keramas Beach;One of the best long Black sand beaches with strong waves (check Tide Table & weather apps before you visit) Recommended for a morning visit, easy to reach via Gojek, but to leave with Gojek, you need to avoid local taxi mafia by leaving till the main road junction, beyond the paddy field (not ideal for sunset / night travel) The beach is clean, if not overlapping with weekends or festival crowds, so no complaints if you visit during non-peak season morning with no crowd. Not recommended for swimming alone as there is no safe guard, you are dealing with Pacific Ocean waves and undercurrent.;;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Keramas%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJH3OlllUU0i0R7gr3r_FVZkY
Irena Westerman;Keramas Beach;Beautiful beach! We combined the beach/surf day with a visit to the Komune hotel. We also rented a surfboard there (100K/hour). Swimming was not recommended due to the coral and possible injuries. But the hotel has a swimming pool, so that compensates. You have to spend at least 300K to sit on the poolside sun loungers. Don't want to? Then you can also sit comfortably at a table in the restaurant.;;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Keramas%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJH3OlllUU0i0R7gr3r_FVZkY

Magdalena Brus;Keramas Beach;Depends on when you come here. During high tide, the beach is clean and quite interesting with its glittering black sand. Cool to watch the surfers. The small bars and the more expensive bar by the Komune Hotel are great places to hang out and watch the waves. However, during low tide, it is full of garbage. It is slightly sad.;;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Keramas%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJH3OlllUU0i0R7gr3r_FVZkY

Grace Ongkowidjojo;Keramas Beach;Follow the direction from Google Maps, and you will encounter a narrow road on the left side that leads to a quite wide area for parking. The beach does not have many locals, so it is relatively free from vendors. Free entry. Apparently, many people surf here.

Mr. Alex Silaev;Keramas Beach;I don't really like this beach. I've been here several times and have seen a lot of garbage in the sea, plastic bags, and other waste.

WM;Keramas Beach;Beautiful black sand beach! There weren’t a lot of people when we were there at 2 pm.

Lauri Ramírez Hidalgo;Keramas Beach;Lovely quiet black sand beach, not heavily exploited, with shiny volcanic sand. A large amount of garbage comes from the small river that flows into the beach and from the sea. We saw some employees cleaning certain parts of the beach (only those that coincided with the resorts and restaurant). When the tide is low, it's more pleasant for bathing, although you'll be surrounded by plastics floating in the water. With the tide high, complicated. Much current and high waves. A good option for surfers??? By the way, if you plan to go there with Grab, be careful about the return if you are staying in Ubud or far from the beach. They take you there, but then no cars arrive at the beach for the return. We tried, and no driver accepted the trip. Finally, we returned to Ubud with a taxi (it will be marked on the way to the beach).;;https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Keramas%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJH3OlllUU0i0R7gr3r_FVZkY

306hayleyp;Amazing black sparkly sand;You need to see the black sparkly sand on this beach to believe how amazing it is. The beach isnt the best for swimming, but great for surfing.

AstridB433;Wild water, good for surfers, not for swinmming;We lived in the Diamond Villas at Keramas Beach. Unfortunately we are not surfer and weren't aware that the beach is not good for swimming so we couldn't use it. We walked some tours and dined at Timor Kitchen (very recommendable) and the Swan Restaurant (nice place). The beach is ok clean and if you like big waves it is nice to sit and look over the wild ocean.;3;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3591831-d1997890-r607546772-Keramas_Beach-Keramas_Blahbatuh_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html

215garyt;Worth a visit;"For visitors such as myself coming from Australia, I am used to white sandy beaches. Keramas does not have that. It has black sand, which is due to the volcanoes of Bali and the black sand shimmers in the sunlight.

The beach itself would be picture perfect if were were not for rubbish left strewn around, which certainly lessens its beauty. However, the rubbish is less than is regularly sighted on Kuta Beach.

Keramas Beach is only 45  minutes drive from Kuta and is worth the visit for a walk along the black sand or to catch to some good sized waves.";4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3591831-d1997890-r540644920-Keramas_Beach-Keramas_Blahbatuh_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html

KristinaT7;Great for surfers, otherwise very dirty;The beach itself is lovely - black volcano sand that sparkles on the sand, great waves and few nice spots to have a drink. Apart from that, unless you're staying at Komuna Resort & Beach Club (which has a small pool with some sunbeds around), you wouldn't want to put your towel on the beach itself. It's literally covered in garbage..;2;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3591831-d1997890-r381752787-Keramas_Beach-Keramas_Blahbatuh_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html

tazawa;Keramas beach is that exotic beauty with dark kohl eyes and long shimmery jet black hair;"If u are seeking a slightly different experience from white sandy beaches, mojitos and beach club pounding loud house music, u may want to explore the keramas black beach
I was looking for something different from a the perfectly manicured gardens and palm trees swaying and keramas beach situated on the south eastern side of Bali is a delightful gem.

There's something introspective and mystical about the black beach that can only be experienced if u do a lone  beach walk,  listening to the symphony of the Indian Ocean and let your imagination reach  the far depths of the oceans trenches. You watch unrelenting waves satisfying the adrenalin  of  surfers, you observe the foamy sea water caressing every black stone that is a little piece of art from the stone carver call the Ocean. You can also spot locals flying kites, Balinese ladies  offering canang to the spirits of the seas, and a smattering of vacationers on the beautiful  beach front villas. 

Komune beach club  is a must visit, they have beautiful Nasi goreng and a good piña colada. 
Do nothing except to breath, soak up the delicious saltiness of the ocean breeze, and catch the sunrise emerging from the distant mount Agung every morning 
If the white sandy beach is that sexy perfectly tanned blond babe,Then the black beach of keramas must surely be that exotic beauty with dark kohl eyes and shimmery black hair";4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3591831-d1997890-r310370721-Keramas_Beach-Keramas_Blahbatuh_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html
PepeCabezas;Hot sand...;This is a great to surf when the wind is blowing onshore on Uluwatu. There is a beck break with lots of fun peaks and a reef brake in front of the Komune hotel.

LukaCaleb;Black sandy beach - amazing to see;What's all the secretness about where the black sandy beaches in Bali are?  There are kilometres and kilometres of them.  Many are very easy to reach and one is Keramas beach about half an hours taxi drive from Kuta.  My wife and I will come back and stay at the nearest resort/hotel next time.  This is a wonderful Balinese beach to visit and see black sand.  It has its own beauty.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3591831-d1997890-r200918156-Keramas_Beach-Keramas_Blahbatuh_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html
