westy54;Home to the Annual Margaret River Surf Classic. Great viewing area.;"The Point has a good parking area, good change room facilities and landscaped viewing areas and lookouts where you get a great view of the beach and, of course, any surfing going on.

The Surf Classic has been held at this site since 1978. There are three different areas Main Break, Surfside and The Box.

I would not swim here though when there is a great beach at Gnarabup a short distance away.";4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1900258-d5957824-r886804978-Surfers_Point-Prevelly_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html

What awesome views over the coastline and when we were there the ocean swell was rolling in the we were lucky enough to watch some very skilful kite surfers.

Surfers Point is really nicely set up with great amenities, huge parking area, nice information boards highlighting surfing history of the point.

VintageIslandGirl;Awesome picnic spot by the beach;"We arrived after an event so it was calm and less crowded. 
It was a scenic drive going to the location. We passed by a few vineyards and specialty local stores and when we finally arrived, there were enough parking spots nearby, saving us from walking too long under the scorching mid-day sun.
We set up our small sun shade tent on a quiet spot by the shore and had a little picnic. 
We watched the giant waves and had the best view of talented surfers. 
There were a few birds around but not enough to disturb our relaxing picnic lunch. 
We'll definitely come back for the sunset experience people rave about on Surfer's Point!";4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1900258-d5957824-r474427968-Surfers_Point-Prevelly_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html
j1954g;The perfect location for amazing sunsets ...;"A stunning place to watch the sunset - best on an evening when there are a few clouds - with a relaxed vibe as people gather on the area overlooking the beach. Don't miss the statue of the surfer at the entrance to the car park.

Easily walked from Prevelly and only a short distance by car from the town of Margaret River. However, for those with mobility issues, there are quite a few steps down to the beach itself, though there are some relatively sheltered benches where you can sit on the way.

mante_vdw;Magnificent ocean, sunset and surfer point;Surfers Point is the best place to gaze at the ocean whilst watching the surfers catch a wave.

mangojacks;THE POINT!!!!!!!;"If you're an ocean-loving-wave-hunting-wind-inspired appreciator of Mother Nature in all her majesty, then Surfer's Point is a must for any visitor to the South West.  

A sublimely crafted carpark atop one of Australia's most famous surf breaks, Surfer's Point is a viewing platform from which to absorb 365 different takes on where the Southern Ocean, Indian Ocean and SW corner of Australia collide.  

The panorama, north, south and west, is unprecedented.  The ocean state, always varied and inspiring.  The fact that you can park up here, at no cost, sit out on the lawn and chill and watch world class surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing and just plain spectacular natural scenery, makes Surfers Point a magnet for all the great energy in this world.  

I'm sure there must be a ley line running through that place. 

Also, the public toilets.  I don't normally comment on such things, but the Surfer's Point public toilets would have to be a contender for the world's most environmentally sensitive designed dunnies.  Someone buy the architect for those ablutions a beer please.  Bravo.

Anyways, as you can see, Surfer's Point. . . . IMO. . . is the place to check out.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1900258-d5957824-r458427864-Surfers_Point-Prevelly_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html

Neither of us have ever surfed, but it was intriguing to watch - and the beauty of the sea & beaches was quite mesmerising.

Bernadette54321;Best Holiday ever;"We stayed in Surfers Point, Margaret River, and all I can say is it was one of the best holidays we have ever had! We arrived and we were delighted to see a modern, beautiful holiday home overlooking an amazing view of a beach. We had 2 houses as there were 12 of us and it worked perfectly! We had a coffee machine with unlimited free coffee pods and a pool right across from our accomodation. We had beaches galore and there was never a dull moment. The kitchen had all the appliances you would need and they were all clean! The bedrooms all had a spa and an on-suite. The fold out bed was very comfortable and perfect for sharing. There was a Tv in every room and the sitting room Tv had YouTube and Netflix! Great for night time entertainment. It was great for a big family! There was also a balcony in every house!

There were many lovely rockpools and a great boardwalk above the beach to make the most of the views. 

Looks like a pretty weird place to surf – get thrown the wrong way and you’d end up straight in a bunch of rocks. 

Lots of very interesting interpretive boards with information about the local surfing history as well as the Aboriginal heritage of the area.

peterbmst;Surf Views on Steroids;Some people may think that the Margaret River region is all about wine tasting and chilling out. But you have to make the journey to Surfers Point.  Even if you've never strapped on a legrope, paddled out into the lineup,  or botched a late take off and gone over the falls,  you'll appreciate the beautiful scenery,  the well set out park and the buzz in the air as surfers head out and return from Mainbreak.

KirkWillett;Another Beautiful Sunset;"I am retired and looking to find as many beautiful sunsets as I can. This one is a new addition to the top of my list. 

Getting to this location is easy. The countryside is beautiful. The roads are paved and well taken care of right up to the parking lot. There are clean public restrooms on hand. There were a number of people there watching with us. I am told it is always busy.

Pokemon Go characters everywhere along with a couple of stops. 

The sea was wonderful for my eyes, my ears, and my emotions. It was cold as the dickens, but, the second evening we were better prepared. 

I recommend this location. You have the option to view the sunset from your car with an unobstructed view, but, of course, I recommend braving the cold [or heat, I am sure it gets hot as hell here in summer] to see this sunset from the grassy area. Oh, you can take the sturdy stairs down to the beach, but, I was too tired from the days touring.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1900258-d5957824-r441046089-Surfers_Point-Prevelly_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html

AlbanyRick;Favourite place on the coast in Prevelly;"This is an amazing place to visit, especially if the waves are big, and there are people out on the water.  Fantastic viewpoint for watching surfers, and if the wind comes up, there will be a lot of windsurfers and kitesurfers as well.  The folks who hit the water here are usually very experienced, so you'll see some high class manoeuvres, spins, and flips happening.  Very fun and amazing to watch. There are great views, but you may want to take some binoculars to get even closer to the action.  

It's also a lovely place to watch the sunset.  There's a lovely grassed area, and it's very popular place for people to chill out and relax as the day draws to a close.

Facilities here include a massive parking area, good toilets, and a gas BBQ (under a shelter).

There are stairs going down to the beach, and it's a fun place to explore and look around.  I'd recommend doing the short walk along the beach to the river mouth - you'll see reef, rock pools, and more.

You can also take a short walk from here on a paved path to the nearby River Mouth.  

The main break here at Surfers Point helped make Margaret River famous, so it's definitely a must visit if you're in the area.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1900258-d5957824-r345096243-Surfers_Point-Prevelly_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html

littlelaney27;Amazing place to watch the surf and sunset;You could sit here for hours watching the waves roll in and then the sun set. it does get quite windy up there.

Even if you don't surf, I recommend checking this place out.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1900258-d5957824-r337416698-Surfers_Point-Prevelly_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html

bellabel7;Wow!;"Beautiful sunsets! Can get quiet packed up there because of it! Everyone love to bring dinner & or wine down there, watch the surfers, kitesurfers & windsurfers. 

Great toilet facilities day & night! 

The only thing that dissapointed me was when the car park was near full a car parked in the walk way area & another had parked in the disabled car park next to it with no acrod sticker. If they had waited 5 more seconds or looked with they're eyes there we spots available/ becoming available. 

Once again praising Josh&Sarah palmalteers surf school near the rivermouth, Awesome people, lots of knowlege & recommended to all ages & stages!

MDLR_Photo;Relaxed NYE at Surfers Point;Nowhere is more suited to soaking in the ambiance of the Margaret River area then lazy upon the grassy banks at Surfers Point with some local cheese and fresh produce with numerous other like minded people.

Perking is more than ample and there is a definite relaxed vibe where people from all walks of life can mingle and enjoy nature at its best.

This was more cars than we'd seen since leaving Sydney.

The headland has been superbly landscaped with steel, rock and wood and has an extraordinary architect-designed facility for public loos, build into the rock. The ambience, view and design of the whole area are exceptional. I'd imagine watching surfing contest here would be incredible.
