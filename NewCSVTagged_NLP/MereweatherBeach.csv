JimGargan_54,suburbia meets surf,"Mereweather Beach Merewether Beach has something to offer everyone irrespective of age or desire. Merewether Beach is situated at the southern end of an uninterupted stretch of golden sand commencing at Bar Beach and including Dixon Park Beach. All three beaches have surf clubs with licensed premises. To the south of Merewether Beach you will find Merewether Ocean Baths which comprises two pools. The smaller pool is intended for families with toddlers. The larger pool measures 100 x 50 metres. The area off the adjacent rock platform is suitable for the experienced snorkler and the more adventurous and confident swimmer. The baths were recently renovated and the amenities have hot (warm) showers. Merewether Beach (like Bar Beach and Dixon Park Beach) are patrolled by Council Life Guards on weekdays and Surf Life Saving Australia Life Savers on weekends. Swimming conditions can vary significantly depending upon tides and wind direction. Merewether Beach hosts ""Surfest"" , a international surfing competition, annually and is the home break for seven-times world surfing champion Mark Richards and NRL legend Andrew Johns. There is plenty of parking close to the beach, but very limited parking for the disabled. Surf House located between Merewether Beach and Merewether Ocean Baths has a variety of venues serving alcohol and meals for different budgets.

troys337,Merewether Beach Southern End,Mereweather Beach Great spot for a day at the beach with the family. Nice sheltered area to the South near the Baths which is great for kids. Good break a bit North with consistently good small to medium surf. Surfclub Kiosk right behind if you need lunch and a great coffee also. Parking can be hard to find when busy due to the limited amount directly near the beach. You can park across the road and link to the beach via the road underpass walkway. No surprise that Merewether was voted the best beach in the country.

Surprisingly, not today. It was busy, but not packed like sardines like last time. Not sure if it's the time of day I visited today or if it's just not as packed as it used to be.

The baths are great and the beach is quite clean and spacious - one of the best in Newcastle.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255325-d3246009-r540159709-Merewether_Beach-Newcastle_Greater_Newcastle_New_South_Wales.html
