HLSHWS,Love this spot for swimming.,Playa Carazillo Puerto Escondido Beautiful little cove for swimming. My husband and I like to arrive by 9AM and lay in the sun on a towel on the beach for a little while and then rent chairs under the shade. It's a fun place to swim. Great people watching too as by 11AM-ish it starts to get pretty busy. Lots of families in the shallow water laughing and having a great time. Rental chairs are comfortable and a nice break from the sun. Excellent half day.,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r942208019-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html
R8290LXkatherines,Okay not worth going out of your way for,"Playa Carazillo Puerto Escondido Pretty beach but very crowded, more of a local beach since the waves aren’t as high as other beaches. The people working at the restaurants there are not very happy with the people that go there, kinda rude. I asked for price on two lounge chairs and umbrella, 400 pesos. I keeps walking to check out other prices and on the way I bought a coconut from another vendor. I went back to the original place to get the lounge chairs since that was the best price. The guys working there glared at us with darting eyes and said “no you can’t sit here any more because you bought something from another place.” Really you’re gonna turn down $400 pesos because I spent $70 on a coconuts? Ridiculous. Over all it’s okay, if it’s on your way check it out but otherwise you’re not missing much.",2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r940612384-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html

Don't come here to surf because if you're not a local, and not Mexican, they will treat you poorly you and tell you to leave.

LongKeel,Pretty beach but chair prices are a bit much.,"Playa Carazillo Puerto Escondido The beach is very beautiful and the stairs aren't that big a deal.  You don't get the killer views without a little bit of exercise.

Unfortunately the access to beach chairs/umbrellas here is a bit odd compared to other places I've been in Mexico.  Normally if you order food and drinks, an umbrella chair is no extra cost and the washrooms are then free.  Here the chair costs were 250-300 pesos.  Considering a 10-15 minute taxi ride in town is around 40-60 pesos the amount for a chair is a bit much.  If they set it at that amount but then deducted it from you food/beverage bill then maybe it would be okay, but as it is, we couldn't be bothered to go back after visiting once.  The food on offer wasn't the best the area has to offer either.  

The big plus for this beach is it is very calm for safely swimming, and the beach and water appeared to be very clean.",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r746780278-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html

Even though Carrizalillo is only a small bay, there are lots of restaurants in a row all squashed together.

Trustytraveler82,What to say but read the review,"Playa Carazillo Puerto Escondido My partner and I hired surfboards from the rental shop on the beach. The surf was quite busy out, especially at the break. In front of the break was a surf lesson with probably 10-12 people in a horizontal line taking up a huge portion of the surfable water. On my first wave I got shouted at by one of the guides saying if I came close to the lesson again he would kill me. No lie. A death threat after catching a wave. I wasn't even relatively close to the lesson considering how many people were in the water. The next time I caught a wave, again he threatened me and swore at me. Other instructors would start shouting at my partner when she began paddling for waves. Overall, it was a pretty nasty experience if you want to surf there. As for swimming, the water can be very strong and rough. A lady was hanging in the shorebreak and fell over, got pulled back and dumped back onto the beach. Myself and 5 others had to carry her from the water so she didn't get pulled back out and repeated. It is a very picturesque beach. However for these factors and the fact that there is almost no room to sit unless you're paying to sit in a lawn chair I would prefer to go elsewhere. Oh yeah one last thing. Unsure whether it was the water or not although it very well may have been but after swallowing some both my partner and I had the worst night in our lives. I got no sleep and spent the whole night excretting liquid from both ends, entirely emptying my stomach many times.",2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r683213933-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html

thomg658,Wonderful beach,"Playa Carazillo Puerto Escondido We spent many hours on this playa. The water is warm, buoyant and perfect for swimming (which amounted to floating, most of the time). There are beach chairs that you can rent two at a time. I believe they offer a deal if you buy food and drinks there. I think we ordered coconuts, pina coladas and cervezas one of our stays here. 

At one point some locals found a cache of baby sea turtles that they rounded people on the playa up to see. They released the turtles on the beach and we watched as they made their way into the ocean. All free of charge. 

We went on a boat trip where the knowledgeable guide told us that Carrizalillo has a fresh water spring nearby. This is where people used to get their water supply from, years ago.

A local in the water at Playa Carrizalillo grabbed my surf shirt by the collar and said ""you broke my board are you going to pay for it?"" Also, ""give me your board because you broke my board"". After I calmly told this local I was not going to pay for either his board, nor give him mine, he said ""get out of these waters, this beach is for locals only"". I had surf lessons all week from a local guide and the first day I went alone this local surfer freaked out on me because I was on the wave he wanted to ride. Would not recommend this beach if you want to surf with your own gear or without a local guide.",1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r676419250-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html

mushaboom,Beautiful Beach - Great Memories!,"Playa Carazillo Puerto Escondido We loved this smaller beach - enjoyed it so much we went 3 days in a row (at various times)  Mornings are less busy and water is just as warm.  We rented umbrellas and chairs from the various restaurants and ate lunch or dinner there too. There are outhouses for 5 pesos at one of the restos near the main stair.  My 7 yr old had a lifejacket on most of the time as he is not a great swimmer yet.  Neither am I so it took a while for us to get used to the waves as we haven't been to many ocean beaches before!  (Waves apparently get stronger in March - whereas Nov - Feb are more calm)  If you are like us, it's better to wade right in to the water than to stand where the water comes up on the beach - as the pull of the water is surprisingly strong there.  Once you are in the water, you can ride the waves.  My husband and my son both took surf lessons on this beach.  Although I was a bit hesitant for my son, they assured me that someone would be with him the entire time and they are trained to work with kids.  They were great with him and he loved the experience.  He ended up doing another lesson the next day.  They even saw 1 of the 3 sea turtles that live near the beach during their lesson! It's truly a beautiful beach!",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r659080609-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html

The beach is small but we loved it.  It’s safe to swim in the bay and while we were there, on two days, we were joined by turtles who swam very close to us.  An amazing experience.

nadine_goranove,Top 10 most beautiful beaches,"Playa Carazillo Puerto Escondido This beach has got to be up there in my top 10 most beautiful beaches I have ever come across. Maybe not ideal for anyone with a push chair, wheelchair or elderly person as you have do go down quite a few flights of stairs in order to get down to the beach. But if there is any way that you can, then it’s definately worth it! 
The water is crystal clear and a gorgeous turquoise colour. The beach looks a bit like a cove in the way that it is surrounded by cliffs, which for some reason gives it a safe feeling. There are a few little bars/ cafes where you can get something to eat if you get hungry while down there (we didn’t go to any of these so can’t comment on what they were like). 

PThe photos attached to this review really don’t do the beach any justice, it was just incredible! Water was a refreshing temperature but it does get deep fairly quickly so be a bit more careful if you’re taking children there. We would end the day there by watching the sun set and it is such a beautiful sight. Everyone just sits and enjoys/ takes it all in.

I took a surfing lesson there, then stayed there the rest of the day!  They have different restaurants with palapas, you have the option of paying for the palapa use or eat at the restaurant then you can stay without paying extra.  Because of its accessibility, it doesn't get crowded and it makes it a thing to do.  You can only get there thru a stairway...which is not that bad!  The restrooms are a trip, they have public ones, you pay 5 pesos for each visit, they are as clean as they can get!  People are very nice, friendly and accommodating.  After my surf lesson, wanted to change, there were no real dressing rooms but the gentlemen offered his storage room where he kept his boards as an alternative!

renting a chair is nice but the prices vary between the bars. one place told us $400 pesos for two people and just pay for it in food and drinks. the next day, we went to a different place and it was $200 pesos just to rent (food and drinks were separate).  you could get away without a chair and umbrella but it might be sunny and hot.
