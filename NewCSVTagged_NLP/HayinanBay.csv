IcyCraze,Nice Cozy Beach Attraction,"Hayinan Bay Nice beach, with some pretty cozy cafe and restaurants along the coast.  Price on the high side, but not outrageous.  Good place to experience the beach culture",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r848290651-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
cosmopolits,Best beach on Hainan.,"Hayinan Bay People are super relaxed and friendly here. We took a Surfing class at Jalenboo Surf School with Kidd and it was great. We came back one month later to take another class with him. The water is clear, the waves are good for beginners and there are many restaurants and cafes where you can hang out. The most chilled place in China!",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r811060592-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
petermQ960YE,Busy and surfy type cool,Hayinan Bay The beach is accessible from a board walk over a stream.  It's big and deeply shelving.  The surf is apparently the best on the island.  Lots of surf schools and cool looking people.  Behind the beach is a strip of restaurants and cafes and a cool little bar with the only gin and tonic we could find in the area.  It's not 4 star but excellent for the beach lover types.,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r762475076-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
J8039OKmartins,Great surfing beach very laid back,Hayinan Bay Had a great surfing coach for my daughter called Psycho. Really nice place. Waves weren't big while we were there which was good for her. A little underdeveloped but I think that's the nice part of it. You'll need to get a rental car to get there,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r761262416-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
C3895XVmarkb,Relaxing and chilled,"Hayinan Bay Less touristy, few beautiful beach and sea. Few good options for staying over eg the forest inn. Most people are here for surfing but we were just passing through for the day/night and were happy to chill on the beach, go swimming and try a spot of fishing. Would be difficult to get to without a private car though.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r714421942-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
bladdamasta,"Will return, and will stay in Riyue Bay","Hayinan Bay Visited twice in two days. Had three great swims, caught plenty of waves and chilled out by the Forest Inn pool. My son had a two hour surf lesson, and caught plenty of waves. Yes, surf can be fickle, but if anywhere is going to get waves, I reckon this would be the place.

There are at least 3 surf clubs here. We went to the original (Surfing Hainan/Jalenboo/Riyue Bay Surf Club). They rent boogie boards and surf boards and provide lessons. My son had a one-on-one two hour lesson and caught waves and professed himself to be not afraid anymorevof padding for waves! Good lesson.

I would have liked to have walked to the Northern point where the best waves would be, but it wasn’t working. That also looks lovely and natural. The beachfront architecture is hotch potch and despite the huge development to the South, there is still a village vibe. There’s enough going on to stay the night. The Forest Inn looked basic but fine.

I stayed in Xinglong, but next time I’d stay in Riyue Bay. Also, water temp was good - not too hot.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r689609168-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
797pete,Disappointing,"Hayinan Bay I had heard about this place as a surf haven, and when I came there were about 5 guys attempting to surf, but the waves just weren't big enough.

If you're not coming for the surfing, there's little to see or do. There are a couple of restaurants and plenty of stalls",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r515400282-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
Beijing_Realist,OK surf spot but not much else,"Hayinan Bay Stayed 3 nights at hotel near riyue wan in december. Had initially planned a longer stay but wind/waves/current was too strong due to offshore typhoon so left early since literally nothing else to do or eat when not surfing. the only hotel here did not have wifi in room and i couldn't watch TV either bc it was blurry and only 6 channels all in chinese. 

so the beach is like any typical beach youll find in australia or america. nothing to write home about but it was uncrowded which was nice. they are building some resort with large cranes over the ocean when i was there so that did kill the scenic beach vibe for me and it is really big so you can see it when youre sitting in the line up or really anytime you look over the horizon out to see, so that was minus. 

the main left break is a far paddle out and definitely tiring when the swells are pumping. you also need to watch out for the reefs as they are all over and under where the main surf breaks. i wore my hard bottom reef shoes and would recommend same for you unless you are experienced surfing shallow reef breaks (i do not, having mainly surfed in california where we dont have many reef breaks). soft bottom booties wouldnt protect you as these reefs felt pretty hard. first day there, i bumped into a local kid that got the underside of his foot torn up bc he was surfing barefoot. many locals do it tho but they are very experienced with this break and surfing over this particular reef. also if you are a taller surfer then the more reason to wear hard reef shoes. 

now the wave... best part, its uncrowded, just handful of locals and beginners usually. unless its pumping and/or overhead, i suspect this wave is more fattish and mellow other than the first section where it hits the shallow reef and throws a bit but then immediately mellows out some with fattish shoulder to play with so overall seems like a fun wave but i only really surfed it once and it was 3-5ft that day. you can def use a funboard or longboard here even when its pumping. they host longboard contests yearly here past couple years i think. shortboard would also work but it is a long paddle out and looked like too much work unless surf is at least 4/5 ft. fish would prob be lot of fun at 3-4ft. 

PRO: good break for more experienced surfers to practice, esp reg footers like myself can work on backhand. the wave seems rippable and is not overly fast with open face available for vertical surfing. would not recommend for beginners bc of the reef. also, the local surf shop is great and super friendly with decent selection of boards for rent. book hotel room through surf shop for better rates or stay at their hostel if solo. 

CON: reef all over and long paddle out; nothing else to do or anywhere else to go when not surfing; lack of food options; lack of public transportation (need to cab it to and from train station)

Overall: if you are here just to surf and you want to surf in china specifically, unless the swells conditions happen to be ideal when you're here, i prob wouldnt come down here just for the swell, in part, bc the other amentiies and infrastructure around the area are really lacking (and you need a wetsuit during the prime season, i.e. winter). if you havent surf traveled much then you can try riyuewan but if you have ever surfed in hawaii, taiwan, california, costa rica, or australia (esp australia which has the best and most consistent glassy surf ive ever surfed) then you may be disappointed unless you time your riyuewan just right to match the right swells (in which case, some great surf sessions can thep trump the fact that there is nothing else to do nearby)",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r450112431-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
jaytripjaytrip,"Nice Landscape, Friendly People, but...","Hayinan Bay When we were there bad waves for surfing: no one to blame for that but hardly anything else to do. Still the surf lesson I got from the guys at surfinghainan.com was pretty good. And people spoke English there and are friendly and helpful. 100 RMB to hire a board. The village itself offers some roadside shops for tourist needs but nothing fancy, it's all very worn down and basic. No ATM, no Family Mart, no pharmacy, no... Don't expect any kind of European comfort. Difficult to find shadow to just sit on the beach. Beach not 100% clean but we've seen worse on Hainan. Water is nice. There's a public bus which we did not use, looks adventurous but without Chinese language skill I guess arranging a car service is the way to get here.",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r419105859-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
Honudolphinlover,Surf day!,Hayinan Bay Beautiful white sandy beach. We mainly experienced the surf shop. Super chill and relaxing place. Workers are welcoming and very friendly. Rented boards for a reasonable price. Comes with free locker. Awesome pizza from the restaurant! Super fresh & good size. Definitely can share! Can't wait to go back!,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r394489756-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
darrong214,My first time surfing,"Hayinan Bay Stayed here two nights and two days. At one end of the beach there are some statues for the tourists to pose by. At the other end there is a rocky granite reef. I saw two men snorkeling there and there were sea urchins and crabs around. Half way along the beach there is a surf club where there is a bar and you can hire surf boards. I was there with a school group and we hired some instructors to teach us to surf. The waves were not enormous, but were great for beginners like ourselves.The water was beautiful to be in. Overall the beach was not particularly crowded, except in the late afternoons when tour buses would roll in for a short time. There are some hotels and restaurants nearby.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r375011920-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
andresp274,Surfing,"Hayinan Bay We have been Here now, And first It Is a little difficult to arrive from the highway Or Wanning By bus. 
Once You get Here It Is everything very simple , You can get a room in a hotel very cheap 60¥ per bed And night. There Are Two parts of the Surfing club, one next yo the hotel Where You check in And one at the beach.
Rent a surf Board Is very cheap 100¥ per day And You have clothes too. And if You Are hungry the restaurant is very good, specially the hamburger And the pizza.
It Is a good experience.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r364282904-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
ramiror434,The Best Beach of China,"Hayinan Bay We went around the whole Hainan Island, and once we got to Riyue Bay, it was paradise on Earth, or at least that is if you like waves and interaction with the ocean, without the crowds. Although everyone in China rushes to Sanya, with their lake like still waters, Riyue allows you to experience a more raw, natural, authentic experience. Facilities are scarce, since it's more a place for Chinese tour groups that stop to eat and take pictures, but don't get wet. So, you have only 4 restaurants, and 3 options for sleeping. During summer the waters are calm and you can go snorkeling. From November to March, it is mostly good for surfing. The beach is calm and clean, compared to other places. There were two camels roaming.
We go as a family, the kids love it. It s the 3rd time, and am sure we ll keep going there as long as we live in China.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r342981502-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
lalac838,Amazing,"Hayinan Bay Simply amazing! For everyone who likes unspoiled nature, beautiful beaches, surfing and photography. Surfing lesson is my top experience. People are friendly and welcoming. If you decide to stay more than one day, hostel at the surf club is great option. At this place, all problems disappear, it makes you relaxed and positive.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r321549207-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
barryh687,"Great bay, but it has a trash problem","Hayinan Bay The bay is beautiful. The surfing is excellent for beginners. The local hotels and hostel are nice. 

But the area has a trash problem. Trash is strewn about the northern end of the beach and up to the point. People have been using the area as a dump.

Moreover, there are a large number of abandoned houses nearby. They're a blight on the land. That's why I didn't come back.

To the local government raking in tourist grants from Beijing: Restore Riyue Bay to its natural beauty. Only then will you see a tourism boom.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r287319020-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
JimAbroad,Not enough to be put on the world surfing map,"Hayinan Bay The left hand point is a nice fun wave and generally protected from the wind all day for round the clock sessions. A half decent length ride best for long boards unit it gets 3-4ft plus. Tides are small and have little effect. The beach has more size and power but while I was there very square with no banks to form peaks, its was just 50m shore break close outs. One day a few guys on boards were out playing it. If you plan staying a while watch for national and international competition times to avoid competing with a packs of pro surfers. I cut my trip short because of this.

A little difficult to get to unless you pay top dollar for a taxi otherwise get to Wanning and try for a bus that will take about 40-60min and could be packed with locals and school kids. Unless you are serious for a surf I would't bother as there is almost nothing else going on here. There's a large shed structure in which you'll find a surf shop (Surfing Hainan) with a surprising selection of boards to rent, and a basic restaurant that specialises in local seafood for day tripper groups of Chinese. Meat and fish dishes are on the pricey side but are OK and several staff speak OK english. After dark a few other basic places spring up.

There is really only one hotel (Hotel 21) in town for an extended stay, I couldn't find it online to book or read reviews. Rooms are reasonably priced, breakfast is rather basic and little english is spoken. A US teacher from Haikou just pitched his tent next to the surf club!

The surf may be OK if thats all you came for otherwise its just a underdeveloped empty beach.",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r185263534-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
haikouguy,Quiet oasis today - future surfing Mecca tomorrow,"Hayinan Bay A little difficult to get to if you are travelling to Hainan, however its well worth the visit as a day trip or overnight.
Clean beach, clear waters and best of all good surfing from Sept-April.  Currently international surfing tournaments are held during the fall/winter, but outside of that you'll have the beach to yourselves.  Makes for very quiet and peaceful times, can enjoy camping next to or on the beach, and a nighttime bonfire.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r165126045-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
