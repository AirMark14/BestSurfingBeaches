Christine2335,Quiet Small Beach,"Sandy Beach Rincon While staying in Isla Verde my husband and I decided to spend the day checking out Rincon. It was about a two hour drive on a Friday. I had researched a few Rincon beaches to check out and Sandy Beach was one of them.  It's not advertised with signage on the road so it was hard to find.  Small parking lot, no one around.  There are houses on the beach so those occupants were around, but that's it. We were approached by a couple guys selling homemade lava cakes, which we bought for $5 each and then were stopped by a guy who ran out of gas and needed money, so we gave him some.  At this point, we took some pics on the beach, drank a few beers then moved on.  I wouldn't waste my time stopping.  We found the downtown public beach had more facilities, a restaurant and not do desolate. Don't get me wrong, we do like quiet beaches with few people like on Vieques, but this one wasn't very appealing.",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d288387-r678611426-Sandy_Beach-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html

Unfortunately there had been a storm during our visit (my GF and I) and we had several days of dangerous rip currents. When we got calm days at the end of our trip we took advantage of a glass like sea. We loved our time in Rincon and plan to return. San Juan on the other hand reminded us of rude driving like NYC!

938chelseyb,"Fun to walk and find sea glass, beautiful views, better for surfing than swimming.","Sandy Beach Rincon The views on this beach are beautiful. You need to be careful because it has a lot of rocks and coral under the water. The river mouth is where you will find more sea glass, and it is usually best after storms, you can look through the area where there are shells and the glass will be within there. The rays of the sun on the water were picturesque. I went in May and for a lot of my walk I had the beach to myself which was very cool!",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d288387-r372372287-Sandy_Beach-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html

maeberlingeri2018,Coolest beach,"Sandy Beach Rincon Great fun for surf watching, sunning or just walking.  Swim at your own risk, but fabulous.  If you only see surfers stay out of the water unless you have your own board.

jvcasjvl,Beach Vacation,"Sandy Beach Rincon First visit to West Coast. Beautiful beach but sand is not as soft as others meaning bigger grains. Sand gets extremely  hot during day for walking. Great for families not looking for calm, glass like beach. Best spot is right by Tamboo for the shade, music & drinks. Kids are 13 & 11 and the locals got my kids interested in surfing.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d288387-r361912592-Sandy_Beach-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html

Chill on the sand, rent a surfboard, go snorkling, or hang out with a Medalla on the deck at Tamboo.  So easy.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d288387-r359407339-Sandy_Beach-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html
Junglechet,Wide and windy!!,Sandy Beach Rincon A lot of surfers hit sandy beach. It is on the north side of the island and just about 15 minutes north of Rincon. There are some nice local shops tucked in along the beach. The prevailing wind tends to come out of the north east and so this beach gets the big wind. As a kite flyer I love it!! Not a great swimming beach because there are a lot of waves and it can be rough. But it's a great place to watch surfers and hang out on the white beach.,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d288387-r359200459-Sandy_Beach-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html

Fantom_Gormay,"Nice area but somewhat isolated from the town of Rincon, so think twice before you stay here.","Sandy Beach Rincon Beach area north of Rincon by about 10 minutes, up the somewhat harrowing (ie narrow, steep and windy ) 413 and then you need to turn left either just before or after the Lazy Parrot ( and back down the hill ) to get there.  Casual and surfer-friendly.

Quite a few places to stay but not that convenient if you're heading back and forth to town ( due to the route ). 

It's obligatory to check out Tamboo for lunch, dinner or the nighttime bar scene.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d288387-r350531372-Sandy_Beach-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html
