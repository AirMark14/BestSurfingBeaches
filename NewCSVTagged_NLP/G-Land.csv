Unfortunately, when I visited last December, the beach was low tide so we couldn't see the waves.

The waves on the beach are quite brave so no one plays in the water, and there are also many gazebos for visitors to rest, and there are many monkeys, and as long as we don't disturb the monkeys, they won't disturb us.

The Terrace Limestone of Blambangan Peninsula at Plengkung Beach in the southern part of Alas Purwo National Park, on the Blambangan Peninsula, reveals light brown-colored limestone rocks with a large amount of mollusk shells and coral fragments. While sand-sized limestone (calcarenite) contains planktonic and benthic foraminifera.
This limestone is a constituent of the karst landscape in the Blambangan Peninsula dating back to the Neogene, known as the Punung Formation. The karstification process on the surface of the limestone rock forms lapies or karren structures. Abrasion on the limestone cliffs produces sea-level notches with heights between 1.5-2 m above sea level on average. In the distance, to the north, three rows of beach terraces can be observed.
The presence of these beach terraces indicates the continued tectonic uplift activity in the southern part of Java Island. Plengkung Beach in the Banyuwangi area is known for its high-layered waves, making it a very famous international surfing location. Lava beneath the limestone terrace, volcanic mountains in the north formed on the mainland.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Plengkung%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJnWsyFcGS0y0RSMfwgrmST4E

Ekspedisi kentang,Plengkung Beach,"G-Land As a country famous for having one of the longest coastlines in the world, Indonesia has many beautiful beaches. Their beauty is even popular overseas, one of which is Plengkung Beach in Banyuwangi, located in the southeastern part of Java Island. The beach, popularly known as G-Land, faces the Indian Ocean directly, so this beach has fairly large waves. The waves at Plengkung Beach are long, high, and have high speed. In addition, the waves at Plengkung Beach also roll into almost perfect wave tubes, making it a favorite among surfing enthusiasts. In 1972, a group of American surfers organized an expedition to Plengkung. This expedition was followed by 8 groups of surfers. Three of them departed with rented boats, while 5 other groups took the land route. The land group traveled until they arrived at Grajagan Village. From Grajagan, they traveled 20 kilometers to reach Plengkung by following the coastal waters using surfboards. After a tough journey and a shortage of clean water (which they collected during rain and the rainwater stuck to the boat's sail), the group using rented boats landed directly at Plengkung. Shortly after arriving, they set up a base camp to survey the surfing spots. They stayed at Plengkung for 10 days. A surfer named Mike Boyum helped establish the first surf camp at Plengkung. This surf camp was eventually taken over by a Balinese surfer named Bobby Radiasa in the late '70s and continues to this day. Inspired by the surf camp owned by Boyum/Bobby, other surf camps started opening in Plengkung. Among them are G-Land Bobby's Surf Camp which offers complete accommodations and facilities at relatively affordable rates. Additionally, there are Joyo's Surf Camp and G-Land Surf Camp.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Plengkung%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJnWsyFcGS0y0RSMfwgrmST4E

Agung Tri Widodo,Plengkung Beach,"G-Land Pantai Plengkung Alias G-land, Tempat Berselancar Kelas Dunia Salah satu pantai di Banyuwangi yang popularitasnya sudah mendunia adalah Pantai Plengkung. Hal ini karena Pantai Plengkung yang terletak di Taman Nasional Alas Purwo ini, memiliki ombak yang sangat tinggi dan besar, sehingga banyak mengundang minat para peselancar tingkat dunia untuk menaklukkannya.  Pantai Plengkung diakui sebagai spot surfing terbaik di Asia Tenggara dan ombaknya termasuk satu dari tujuh ombak terbaik di dunia. Ombak di tempat ini sungguh besar dan konsisten merupakan hasil pengaruh arus Antartika, yang terbawa oleh Samudera Hindia. Dengan sudut teluk yang tepat, ombak yang dihasilkan adalah sempurna. Ketinggian ombaknya konon bisa mencapai 4-8 meter dengan panjang 2 km, serta memiliki formasi gelombang tujuh bersusun, sangat menantang bagi pecinta surfing untuk mencobanya.  Ombak di pantai ini dibagi menjadi 3 tingkatan yaitu Kong Waves (tinggi ombak mencapai 6-8 meter), Speedis Waves (5-6 m), dan Many Track Waves (3-4 m). Ombak tingkat terakhir (many track) biasanya digunakan para peselancar pemula untuk mengasah skill mereka.  Selain di Pantai Plengkung, ombak sebesar itu hanya ada di Hawai dan Afrika Selatan. Dan puncak kedatangan ombak terjadi pada April hingga Agustus setiap tahunnya. Di pantai  ini pernah diadakan lomba selancar internasional Quicksilver Pro Surfing Championship pada tahun '95, '96, dan '97 serta Da Hui Pro Surfing World Championship seri III tahun ‘2003. Dengan potensi yang dimilikinya, tak pelak lagi Pantai Plengkung pun dikenal sebagai surga bagi para peselancar professional.  Pantai Plengkung yang berhadapan langsung dengan Samudera Hindia dan berlokasi di timur Teluk Grajagan ini begitu digemari para peselancar yang pada umumnya berasal dari luar negeri. Tidak mengherankan jika Pantai Plengkung lebih populer di mancanegara daripada dalam negeri. Mayoritas wisatawan justru datang dari Amerika, Brasil atau Australia. Dari para peselancar asing yang mengagumi keindahan gulungan ombak di Pantai Plengkung inilah kemudian muncul sebutan G-Land bagi Pantai Plengkung. Sehingga bagi turis asing, mereka lebih mengenal G-Land daripada Pantai Plengkung.  Darimana asal-usul nama G-Land itu muncul? Di balik sebutan G-Land untuk Pantai Plengkung ternyata memiliki banyak versi. Huruf “G” pada G-Land ternyata merupakan singkatan dari beberapa hal, yaitu :  Dari kata “Grajagan” yang merupakan nama sebuah teluk, yaitu Teluk Grajagan. Diambil dari kata “Green” karena letaknya di tepi hutan tropis yang hijau. Lingkungan di sekitar Pantai Plengkung merupakan green forest, karena letaknya dikelilingi hamparan hutan pantai tropis dan hutan dataran rendah yang masih asri, maka jika dilihat dan diabadikan dalam foto dari jarak jauh, maka akan nampak berwarna kehijauan. Diambil dari kata “Great” karena ombaknya yang begitu besar, panjang dan penuh tantangan. Ada juga yang menyebutkan, Plengkung disebut G-Land karena pantainya melengkung mirip huruf G. Sebutan pantai Plengkung bagi penduduk lokal itu karena bentuk pantainya melengkung. Bila dilihat dari citra satelit, pantai ini bentuknya memang melengkung membentuk huruf G terbalik. Posisi dan letak pantainya itulah yang membuat ombak setinggi hingga 8 meter bisa terbentuk, yang membuatnya disukai para pecinta surfing.  Bagi yang hobi surfing maka G-Land atau Pantai Plengkung merupakan wisata yang wajib di kunjungi. Anda bisa mencoba belajar surfing kilat pada para mentor yang ada di sana. Namun jika anda tidak mempunyai hobi berselancarpun tetap saja pantai ini layak di kunjungi. Menyaksikan dari dekat para surfer yang sedang berselancar di tengah laut adalah sebuah pilihan yang menarik.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Plengkung%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJnWsyFcGS0y0RSMfwgrmST4E

fery12022000,Surfer Heaven!!!,"G-Land Indeed, you can't deny this beach has something the surfer need most, wave!  On August is the best for breaking into the wave. Very challenging! Good accessiblity by speed boat or chopper, but land transportation still become an issue. Just bring your surfing board which is supported by airlines now by giving a special handling into the airplane and airport.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g317103-d3295865-r537283162-G_Land-Banyuwangi_East_Java_Java.html

There are a lot of foreigner here that come to try to surf in here, so there are also surfing camp here that provide if you want to stay for a night in here.

elbicnivni,Heaven in The Middle of Nowhere,"G-Land This beach was superb! The wave is the best after Hawaii, they said. And I found it fascinating! You can find some of the 'camp' here, managed by their private owner. One camp consisted of some bungalow, maybe even cottage. They're full of lives, the living in a jungle kind-of-living style. I enjoyed my stay here, although I have to use mosquito net at night, torch-light to light up my path at night, wooden chairs, cold beer, and far from the city crowd!

Heaven for surfers!",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g317103-d3295865-r387312922-G_Land-Banyuwangi_East_Java_Java.html

930jaredd,Expensive for foreigners and dirty,"G-Land The entry for foreigners to enter the park is 150,000 per day??  That's far too high a price when the roads and facilities are terrible and like other Indonesian national parks full of rubbish.   Then when you arrive 7km from the beach, you are not allowed to take your own motorbike down to the beach and have to pay 250,000rp for a private taxi.   I would suggest boycotting Indonesian national parks until they sort out their pricing and their facilities.",1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g317103-d3295865-r336888430-G_Land-Banyuwangi_East_Java_Java.html

reynovbp,Explore the nature,"G-Land Well, it tooks us more 4hrs drive to finally reach the beach known as GLand. 2.5 hours driving from Banyuwangi to arrive at the gate where you paid the pass to enter the national park. This beach one of the location in Alas purwo national part, the also have savana and other beaches that you could visit using your own car.
For the GLand its selves it still require 15 minutes to another gate where you park the car and report to jungle ranger your id and plan. And then you talk to Pak Komar as a coordinator to arrange your transportation to GLand (plengkung beach). You need to pay 250.000 idr for a car and a driver to drive and pick up for the return, they only have 6 cars where you need to wait until they retun from dropping other visitors. It takes 45mnts to arrive at the plengkung beach or you could walk for about 10km, i've seen some teenagers in group walking through the forrest.
Don,t complain about the road condition since the goverment will try to keep the part remain the same including the whole ecosystem from human interference.
Some advice : dont expect too much for the beach , it's not for kids or family visit, mostly for surfers. And ask the driver's mobile number  you need it to ensure when he will come back to pick you up.
There are some surfers camp you could rent for 450rb/person/night or 100$/Overseastourist/night.
Only mobile provider tel*omsel can reach this location :(",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g317103-d3295865-r272708836-G_Land-Banyuwangi_East_Java_Java.html

climberchica,amazing surf and setting,G-Land This is a truly amazing surf location and setting.  The national forrest is alive with animals that seem to have all but disappeared in other areas of Indonesia.  The monkey are definitely a little more wild than those you  come across at temples that attract the tourists.,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g317103-d3295865-r225145594-G_Land-Banyuwangi_East_Java_Java.html
theo1006,Walking to G-Land,"G-Land The government has left Plengkung Beach (alias Grajagan alias G-Land) in Alas Purwo National Park to private enterprise.  Three surf camps (a fourth one went broke) accommodate surfers at inflated prices - typically USD 70 to 110 for full board - after they have been shipped over from Bali.  While we would not deny these surfers their favoured sport, we do regret that the accommodation for wildlife watchers at Trianggulasi has been discontinued by the authorities.
At early morning we walked the 9 km from the Pancur checkpoint to G-Land along the road close to the beach but mostly shaded by trees.  We were rewarded by the sounds of birds and the sight of a deer family crossing the road.  Of course there were monkeys in the trees too.  At some places one can take a dip in the sea, but later in the morning the water is too low for swimming.  The surfers too then come back to shore and wait for the next high tide in the afternoon.
When we walked back later in the day we were fortunate that Mr Giran's jungle taxi overtook us.  As his car was empty he let us hop on for Rp 25,000 p.p.  If you need transport to or from G-Land, call him at mobile 081 348 757 511.
Directions: From Genteng the distance to G-Land is about 57 km, from Banyuwangi it is perhaps 10 km more.  We followed signboards “Wisata Plengkung” which led us the border of the park near Tegaldlima village. But the ticket office is 10 km further south at Pasar Anyar, and from the barrier at Pancur you have to either walk the last 9 km (two hours) or take a jungle taxi (45 minutes, Rp 250,000 irrespective of the number of passengers).
Admission: At the ticket office we paid Rp 2,500 p.p. for admission, Rp 6,000 for our car and Rp 5,000 for bringing a camera.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g317103-d3295865-r211052190-G_Land-Banyuwangi_East_Java_Java.html
P_devillermont,G-Land for the Adventurous,"G-Land Although the road is mostly in a terrible condition, and taking a long time to get there (2 and a half hour to do 60 kms). I don't regret going there, through the orange groves, teak forests, etc.. until a parking area, where one has to go for a 4x4 vehicle ride through the final 5 kms stretch to one of the most beautiful white sanded beaches. Plengkung as it is known, has some of the best waves, attracting surfers from Kuta; who do the trip by fast boats.
One can see all sorts of animals in the forest from peacocks, to Deers, strange monkeys, Komodo-like lizzards, etc... Great place! but bring your own lunch, to have in one of the few spots prepared for the occasion. the few restaurants on the beach are very expensive...as deliveries are scarce and risky.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g317103-d3295865-r160644552-G_Land-Banyuwangi_East_Java_Java.html
