Quite a few people around and plenty of surfers (perhaps the dregs from the the recent RipCurl Pro-Surfing competition. The swell was beckoning, so after snagging a few rad pipes, we dried off and ventured further south.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g261667-d589955-r948867058-Bells_Beach-Torquay_Victoria.html
396anitah,Wave Right,"Bells Beach For the seasoned surfer, Bells beach renowned for its yearly Rip Curl pro surfing competition which attracts the international elite of its sport, offers long waves & big swells that are a board riders paradise. The surrounding headland provides a great vantage point to view the competition or just watch the aerial views on display by the daily surfers who attempt to master the waves. Acknowledgement is given to the land that was first home to the Gulidjan aboriginal peoples. Bells beach has brought great prominence to such surfing legends as: Kelly Slater, Mick Fanning, Mark Occhilupo. Its iconic long winding, wooden staircase & stunning sunsets make for a photographers dream. This is a must stop in Torquay along your drive on the Great Ocean Road.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g261667-d589955-r941258770-Bells_Beach-Torquay_Victoria.html

PaulL148,Speaking as a non surfer....,"Bells Beach In the interest of full disclosure I've never 'hung ten'. Or even 5...

So as a non surfer what was Bells Beach like? Well it is nice to see a place that's famous even if in a sphere you don't normally swim in. But for the non surfer the appeal is that it's quite an interesting little cove and beach. It's darn near perfect in shape with cliffs surrounding in. There are multiple lookouts there where you can get good views and watch the surfers do their thing. 

There is a reasonable amount of parking and facilities and you can include checking the place out in between checking out Jan Juc Beach and Bird Rock Lookout. So even if you aren't a surfer this is still a worthwhile piece of coastline to check out.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g261667-d589955-r918430141-Bells_Beach-Torquay_Victoria.html

gregs3071,Busy in in the quietest of times,"Bells Beach I visited Bell's Beach on day one of my Great Ocean Road tour which was the Winter Solstice. It was cold and foggy but the fog was not thick.

I pulled over as soon as I saw a sign saying Bell's Beach. The car park was of a decent size and there were not many cars there. A sign by a path indicated a 10 minute walk to Bell's Beach.

The path along the cliff top was quite chilly. I was wearing a beanie and a hooded jacket. I'm not one who feels the cold terribly but I needed to pull the hood over my beanie.

At the end of the path there was another, larger car park, with more cars parked and a crowd of people lining the fence. That was the Bell's Beach/Winki Pop car park.

The car park and viewing area is at the top of the cliff over looking the beach. There were somewhere between 20 to 30 surfers in the water. I had stopped 3 times at other beaches on the way and this was by far the most surfers I had seen. The surf looked pretty good.

I did not venture down to the beach itself. I took a couple of pictures from the lookout and returned back down the path to my car. I had many places to visit that day.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g261667-d589955-r800576239-Bells_Beach-Torquay_Victoria.html

Great event and well worth the trip.  Tips: 

Download the app and get to the event early in the morning before 7.00am to bet traffic and crowds. 

Take something to sit on or protect your bum from the rocks. 

Dress in layers as it gets cold then hot etc. 

Relax and enjoy.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g261667-d589955-r672919417-Bells_Beach-Torquay_Victoria.html

AmyM1408,Bucket List.... tick.,"Bells Beach So my boyfriend has been raving about ticking this off the Bucket List his whole life.  We’re from Queensland and are spoilt for choice with Beaches, so of course I had to see what all the fuss was about.  
It was a very cold windy day on the first leg of the Great Ocean Road tour and the water wouldn’t have been more than 16 degrees. Those mad surfers were suited up in the full face and body wet suits getting absolutely pounded by the fresh, rough waves that break direct on to Rocks and sharp Sandstone. 
The yellow, red and black sand was interesting. It looked like it would be sharp under foot, however it was soft and not sticky.  The lookout and the view was breathtaking and best vantage point to watch the madmen.

Quite a few surfers out in the water no doubt getting the feel of the place before competition starts.

0591TimS,Too cold and windy for viewing action in the surf - should have checked the weather,"Bells Beach Let's face it, Bells beach is a surfing icon so it's a must see for anyone with any interest in surfing or just to see a famous beach. It's certainly picturesque but we'd hoped to see surfing action and the chop was too severe and nobody was in the water. That's nature......

It's a beautiful beach nonetheless and we enjoyed walking down onto the sand.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g261667-d589955-r532522646-Bells_Beach-Torquay_Victoria.html
