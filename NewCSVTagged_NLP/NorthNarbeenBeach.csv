Major (meaning international) surf competitions and at least one rock concert have been held here but its fun just to walk to the rock pool or go for a swim in the ocean.  If you like beach photos dawn is the best time and there are pelicans on the Narrabeen Lagoon where it empties into the ocean which are especially good photo subjects.

Ellemay,lovely !,"North Narbeen Beach North Narrabeen is apart of Narrabeen Beach &  includes Birdwood Park and Narrabeen Lagoon located on the Northern Peninsula. If wanting a secluded private beach North Narrabeen has plenty of space & is not crowded like Manly or Dee Why. 

 Narrabeen Lakes, which is a very popular spot for families and water sports, such as rowing, fishing, boating, windsurfing, canoeing, sailing, waterskiing, and kayaking. This is a great beach for learners. The Lakes are situated around numerous reserves, which also contain Narrabeen Caravan Park, which is a Sydney icon. 

There are some excellent walking tracks around the lagoon and lakes. South Narrabeen Beach is located at the end of Clarke Street; it has a surf club with facilities. Narrabeen Beach also has a surf club with plenty of cafes and restaurants available.

North Narrabeen is famous for being one of the best surf breaks in the world, many world championship competitions are held here regularly. The reason the surf is so good is because of “Shark Alley” a deep channel and with the lagoon emptying into the sea creates a sandbar, which then produces extraordinary waves.  

By transport catch the 182 L87, L88 or L90 from Wynyard or the bus 155 or 157 from Manly. 

Plenty of facilities are available including change rooms, toilets, showers, & parking .",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2034319-d589953-r311941597-North_Narrabeen_Beach-Narrabeen_Warringah_Greater_Sydney_New_South_Wales.html

Robyn25,Take time to have a look around,"North Narbeen Beach Narrabeen and North Narrabeen are approx. 40 minutes North of the CBD. You can get there by bus or car. Narrabeen sits between the beach and the shores of a lake/lagoon. At first glance it doesn't seem much but get out and walk around. The lake has a shared path all the way around that is great for an easy ride or long walk. At present (May) the lake has a family of black swans visiting. And has huge numbers of ducks and other sea bird life around and in it. You can walk over the classic concrete bridge and under some pelicans that seem to sit on the light poles, there all day. Under the bridge, people fish (I saw a guy catch a huge flathead from there) and there are swallow nests built into the foundations. There are heaps of small cafes spread through out Narrabeen that do great coffee, The Deli on Waterloo was lovely, Waterloo is the name of the street it is on. Most of the people seem friendly and bike riding is an easy way to get around here. There are farmers markets on during the day on Fridays behind the caravan park. Narrabeen has an amazing headland that  looks out to Long Reef and has a great walking track  around it. And of course it has a good surf beach and a well maintained rock pool. The caravan park is rated as one of the best in Australia but it does have a price to go with it. Just North of Narrabeen is Warriewood, which also has great cafes and a lovely little beach and headland walks. The sunrises are beautiful and the water is still warmish.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2034319-d589953-r130264067-North_Narrabeen_Beach-Narrabeen_Warringah_Greater_Sydney_New_South_Wales.html
