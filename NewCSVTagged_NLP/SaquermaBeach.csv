MarceloR179,"A bit strong beach, but with good and pleasant structure","Sasquerma Beach The beach is beautiful, but you can't fool around, because it's strong, it has a lot of waves. There is a point where there are stones that is the best point, because the stones break the waves a little. At this point there is also a good structure for bathers, chairs and tables to sit and a menu to choose what you want on the sand. They don't charge for the table or the chair, but you have to consume something. Overall, I like this beach as it looks clean and has a good structure, although it has a lot of waves.",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1096016-d4010884-r552898593-Praia_de_Itauna-Saquarema_State_of_Rio_de_Janeiro.html

The water is super cold, but too clean. Be careful with jellyfish. There are street vendors during this period, selling popsicles, cheese, shrimp, pies, bags... and there are stalls that serve by selling food and drinks, portions of fish and rental of tables and chairs, which usually leave for free with a minimum of R$ 30.00 of consumption.

There are no toilets or anything near for you to drink water or eat something.  The sea was too cold and rough, with very big waves!
