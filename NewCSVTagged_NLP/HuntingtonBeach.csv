C Horn,Huntington State Beach,"Huntington State Beach We visited Huntington Beach twice, both on weekends, one was Memorial Day weekend.
The beach was busy but not crowded. Even though there were a lot of people there was plenty of space.
There were lifeguards on duty, a craft fair both times, numerous volleyball nets, bikes to rent, a paved walking/biking path, street musicians, sprinklers for washing sand off your feet, and food stands.
There are a great many restaurants on the opposite side of the road from the beach, with menus to fit different budgets, as well as some shops.
Parking Price is very widely. It is $20 parking to get into the state park, parking lots on the beach. One parking area wanted $1.50 for every 15 minutes! We will grateful we stumbled into the underground parking garage with entrance on 6th Street, one block away from the beach. We were parked there for 1 hour and 51 minutes and it cost us $3 on Memorial Day weekend.
I was surprised at how many chewed up bits of plastic there were washed up on the beach from the tide. Part of a plastic bag here, a bottle cap there... The pieces were small, but there were lots of them. That has nothing to do with Huntington Beach I am sure, rather all the beaches and the area are probably the same.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Huntington%20State%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJVbrtcKoh3YARKN871uXwqCI

Liz R,Huntington State Beach,"Huntington State Beach Born & raised in HB, I grew up playing on these beaches and loved every minute of it. But I've noticed in recent years (since the pandemic ) that the homeless population has slightly increased, which brought on more dirty restrooms and some public sitting areas were strewn with clothes or personal items from someone who was displaced and living out there on the beach. It looks like Parks and Recreation are stepping up their maintenance of all facilities by having their restrooms and all other public facilities checked and/or cleaned every few hours. Other than that, everything else was great! Clean beaches and water. Very family friendly. And beautiful sunsets!

It wasn't crowded at all the Sunday afternoon we visited. I wish the waves were a little bigger so the kiddos could better play with their boogie boards, but overall it was alright. Sand castles were built, kids were buried, and we had a great time. This is my second trip to this particular beach and my experience was the same (though less crowded this time) both times.

My only complaint would be that we didn't have a bathroom with showers bear us, just individual stalls on the outside of the building and of the 2 two showers outside, 1 was very high pressure and was slightly painful.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Huntington%20State%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJVbrtcKoh3YARKN871uXwqCI
