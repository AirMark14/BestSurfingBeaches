GailHagemann;Supertubes, Jeffreys Bay highly recommended;I have stayed here before but it was a few years ago. However, the standard has continued to be high.  Very comfortable room, including the expected comforts for a good quality B&B. Good location next to the beach. Staff are very friendly. Winston was particularly helpful with my late arrival, early departure one night stay, making sure I had an excellent breakfast, next to the fireplace, before I left on that cold morning.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469383-d4438560-r771150131-Supertubes-Jeffreys_Bay_Eastern_Cape.html

iamjoshwarren;I saw gary glitter here!;"Savile worked in coal mines as a teenager, reportedly sustaining spinal injuries at the age of 14, and was a Bevin Boy during the Second World War.[9] He began a career playing records in, and later managing, dance halls, and was said to have been the first disc jockey to use twin turntables to keep music in constant play. His media career started as a disc jockey at Radio Luxembourg in 1958 and on Tyne Tees Television in 1960, and he developed a reputation for eccentricity and flamboyance. At the BBC, he presented the first edition of Top of the Pops in 1964 and broadcast on Radio 1 from 1968. From 1975 until 1994, he presented Jim'll Fix It, an early Saturday evening television programme in which he arranged for the wishes of viewers, mainly children, to come true. During his lifetime, he was known for fund-raising and supporting charities and hospitals, in particular Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire. In 2009, he was described by The Guardian as a ""prodigious philanthropist""[10] and was honoured for his charity work.[11] He was awarded the OBE in 1971 and was knighted in 1990. In 2006 he introduced the last edition of Top of the Pops.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469383-d4438560-r726639439-Supertubes-Jeffreys_Bay_Eastern_Cape.html

Can get enough of the sunrise, morning after morning.

Endless waves...... 

Always keep an eye out for the dolphins playing around in the waves.

Also a great site when the ""surf is on"" and there are loads of surfers lined up.

This is the annual surf spot with the JBay Winter Fest where surfers from all over the world visit.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469383-d4438560-r652284854-Supertubes-Jeffreys_Bay_Eastern_Cape.html

Jilldutoit;An amazing spot on the coastline!;Such is the popularity of Supertubes that we have found it better to visit off-season, as then we can be gauranteed of a parking place relatively close by.

The food was tasty and the barbecue that they arranged for us on the evening of the business trip was SUPER. I would like to commend the guys who did the ""braai"".

If you're an experienced surfer, this break is also great.
There's a little restaurant in the Supertubes guesthouse just up on the hill and other shops and restaurants aren't too far away.
You cld just sit on the boardwalk and watch the surfing with a coffee or walk for miles on the sand in the summer or winter.

If you just want to swim in the sea or body surf or spend a day tanning and relaxing, it will certainly also receive 5 full stars. One of the best beaches in the world, no doubt about it.

SarahAndTerry;Surf or Observe;Surfing in JBay is some of the best in the world!  My husband is from JBay, and he enjoyed coming back to surf at Super Tubes, and I enjoy watching.  You can go out in the morning and find people already out watching and relaxing for hours.  The view is unmatched, and the relaxed and care free.  No fighting over waves, but the locals don't exactly want to advertise to the new-comers, so the main sign has graffiti over it!  Beginners may not wish to risk the surf, but on a calm day it's fun for all.  Enough beach to grab towels and friends and relax all day!  There are also benches and a park down the road.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469383-d4438560-r270384037-Supertubes-Jeffreys_Bay_Eastern_Cape.html

Jilldutoit;Amazing view;"it is easy to see why Jeffrey's Bay is considered a surfing paradise, not only locally, but internationally. Here at Supertubes, the land rises more sharply from the shore, affording an absolutely stunning view of the surfers catching the break,with the whole wide sweep of the bay visible on clear days. Dophin and whale sightings are commonplace from this vantage point too. 
Although tiered benches have been provided at different points along the boardwalk, there are no ablution facilites at all. The other downside is that parking is limited, very limited, so plan accordingly!";4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469383-d4438560-r230664390-Supertubes-Jeffreys_Bay_Eastern_Cape.html

I returned after a 20 year hiatus (I now live in North America) and the wave is as perfect as it always was.  Pictures are posted (see below).  Parking can sometimes be a problem, so get there early.  No beach showers that I could see, so bring a bucket and some water bottles to rinse off.  Watch the locals enter and exit the break so you can follow their lead and please be mellow in the water.  This is one of the wonders of the surf world and you need to respect it and those that live here.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469383-d4438560-r189785863-Supertubes-Jeffreys_Bay_Eastern_Cape.html
