steven llanuse,Pe'ahi Jaws Surf Break,"This review might be a little contentious. It's not that I think this is a bad spot, it's just overhyped for most of the year. If you're not there when Peahi is breaking, don't bother.

In May 2017, there was no break (obviously), but I really wanted to see this famous spot anyway. The road conditions were terrible. Even in a light 4x4, I was concerned that any rain would trap us at the bottom of the road, unable to drive out. Tons of washouts, junked/burned cars, and a couple of grades that will be very challenging in the wet.

The problem is that the sections with the steepest grades have become extremely washed out and lumpy. You can't carry much speed, so you have to pull your way up. On road tires, you can end up in trouble with any amount of rain.

To put it in perspective, we drove nearly everywhere (including Polihale) on Kauai, which was a cake walk by comparison. In short, the view is nice, but it's not any better than the 100 other cliff views in Maui. Only go out if there is a break. There will be plenty of locals to bail you out for $20 if you get stuck.",,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN052RTdBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x4413412ac514784d!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDR7NvE7AE%7CCgwImtWBogYQwMT50QE%7C?hl=en

Anastasia H,Pe'ahi Jaws Surf Break,"It was great off road trail.

We could have potentially go through, but the last trench was really deep.
Walk from the sign was about 15-20 minutes all the way to the bottom.  Last part of the hike( descending), was a bit steep, but nothing extreme. It’s more slippery on a clay road. The beach was empty and there were no surfers that morning, so we enjoyed absolute solitude and beauty of this spot. On our way back we already met few hikers.

Chris Kucharik (ckactormodel),Pe'ahi Jaws Surf Break,"1st Logistics -- if you have a car, stop on the paid parking on left (don't drive it) off the main road.  If you have an SUV, you can only go 1/2 way & there's really no place to park.  If you have a 4x4, you can only go about another 500ft because the ONLY vehicle that can drive this is a Hawaiian 4x4 (jacked up ground clearance + oversized super mud whumper tires).  Finally if you hike in, give yourself time and bring water (+snack)...take all your trash out, too!

2nd Time of Day & Conditions -- 40' wave is high tide, peak wind.  If you're coming any other time, you can see just as good waves in Ho'okipa.  I still had fun, but it's hard to tell size over distance w/o a reference.

Lisa Whitten,Pe'ahi Jaws Surf Break,"This place is difficult to reach. Do not attempt without four wheel drive. On busy days there is a $10 shuttle that takes you down the old pineapple dirt road to the viewpoint. If visiting, I recommend this option. Many people walk down the dirt road, but prepare for a long, hot, dusty or muddy walk. The view from the cliff is best if you have a powerful zoom lense because the action is pretty far away. The last time I visited it had rained and the road was so muddy that many cars got stuck in the mud.

You don't need a 4x4 but it is handy. You park up the top of the hill and then you will have to walk down to the beach. Turn left and don't follow the path to the right which looks like the path to go on but you need to climb down the left side..don't slip! We got there and there was no waves at all.

Matt Holton,Peahi,Remote spot on the north shore. Wave riders from all over test their skills on the massive Jaws Break.  Great to hike down to the shoreline. Lots of dead cars and trash on the 1.5 mile dirt road down to the break.,,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Peahi&query_place_id=ChIJdTvIBpY1q34RKqFwyzGOkaQ

Jessalyn C. :: Lyfeofjess,Peahi,"BEAUTIFUL stop. Unfortunately there wasn't that much activity going on with the waves, but it was a great stop to check out this legendary place.

BEWARE, people weren't kidding when they said that there's a dirt road. We asked the cashier in the shop before the road to Jaws and she helped us locate the place. However, she did not say how intense this road was. It felt like we went off roading - dirt road, only one lane (hope that no one is going the opposite way), holes everywhere, alot of trash, trenches.... Probably took us about 30minutes of slow driving since we were in a sedan. I would highly recommend ensuring you have a SUV when driving these roads.

Would I recommend this place? It's only worth the drive if you're a HUGE FAN of Jaws and MUST SEE the place even if the waves aren't massive. Then check it out. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend it. The drive, the sight of trash and lack of activity wasn't worth the drive.

You can see the same view in other areas.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Peahi&query_place_id=ChIJdTvIBpY1q34RKqFwyzGOkaQ
Travis Armstrong,Peahi,I drove back here a week ago while on vacation. First off have the proper vehicle. SUV/trucks are the ONLY way to drive back here. You can drive a regular car  however I highly recommend you park and 'walk-in' and the road (dirt) tends to 'gully' and 'washout' after any decent rainfall. Once you reach the roads end (maybe two miles at best) you come to a cliff. Watch the edge! There is some vegetation overgrowth and then just straight down to the rocks. To actually get to the beachhead you have to hike down a small single back trail probably 200'-300' in elevation thru dense rain forest. As someone who has never even held a surfboard it is a lot to ponder why someone would risk life and limb to surf such a fierce and rocky break? Whatever it's still cool to see and take pictures.
