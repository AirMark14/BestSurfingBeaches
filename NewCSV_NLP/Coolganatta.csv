Once at the beach if you follow the walking path towards Tweed Heads you will see a boardwalk that passes up the side of the Rainbow Bay Surf Club.  This is a lovely walk which takes you to Snapper Rocks with viewing areas and seating along the way.    A little further along you will find the Green Frog.  At this point there is a set of stairs to climb up.  Once at the top, turn to the left and follow the steep road which will take you to Point Danger where there are several lookouts.  Of course, if you don't want to walk, you can drive to Point Danger and park in the parking area.  Walk a little further and you will come to Captain Cooks Memorial and lighthouse.  If you continue to walk you will come to Duranbah Beach and further on you will arrive at duranbah seawall.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255335-d2334163-r875681042-Coolangatta_Beach-Coolangatta_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html

lovemakingmemories,"Beautiful beaches, amazing location","I took my daughter to Coolangatta for the weekend.  We loved the clean and breathtaking beaches and the general ambiance of the area.  If you don't like the beach, you can go across to the river and watch the dolphins playing in the water or spot the array of fish swimming close to the rocks.  There is also a lovely little inlet with a small beach so that you can swim in the calm and refreshing water.  There are plenty of places to eat and so much variety that it is hard to choose.  My daughter loved that there was a Time Zone near the local Woolies and we spend some time in there in the evening after our feast at Grilld.  The people are friendly and helpful.  We stayed at the Greenmount Resort and it was super close to everything but there are so many places to stay.  There are even a few Air bnb's to stay at which seem to be very reasonable and very close to everything.  I definitely recommend putting this place on your bucket list, in fact I am going back again in 3 weeks.  :)",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255335-d2334163-r723886773-Coolangatta_Beach-Coolangatta_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html

elainem678,Beautiful beach location and shops cafes and restaurants so close by,Cooly beach as the locals call it has something for everyone- but limited beach front parking - with a thriving shopping area cross the road. Lots of accommodation and for night life the Cooly Hotel is close. If you want the Gold Coast experience but don’t want the over commercialised Surfers Paradise tourist feel this is the place . Suitable for families with all aged children,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255335-d2334163-r629422636-Coolangatta_Beach-Coolangatta_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html
