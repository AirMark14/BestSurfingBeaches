ppjhsw,Snapper Rocks is perfect.,"I have been to beaches all around the world and not one of them can match Snapper Rocks, Rainbow Bay, Coolangatta and Kirra. Fine white sand, crystal clear, clean water, consistent breaks, safe, patrolled, family friendly, not crowded, and space to spread out. Friendly locals, relaxed and always sparkling! Even on a rainy day there is a special atmosphere that simply cannot be matched.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255335-d1991157-r504631638-Snapper_Rocks-Coolangatta_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html

991ginad,Love this Beach!,"Snapper Rocks is a surf beach which never disappoints. If the surf is up, you can watch the board riders for hours - absolutely amazing & there can be 50 plus board riders out doing their best!  If you are lucky, you can see dolphins shooting the waves especially during sunrise or sunset.  There is a safe swimming beach around the corner @ Rainbow Bay, but leave Snapper Rocks for the surfers!",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255335-d1991157-r500673804-Snapper_Rocks-Coolangatta_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html

DaleP253,Great place to visit for all ages.,Having had breakfast at South East Espresso on Boundry St we headed for drive to Snapper Rocks. Parking is little bit of an issue however my mum had her parking sticker. We were able to park right at the end of Snapper Rocks Rd with an easy level walk around to the rock pools. A lovely sojourn in the sun before heading home. Have visited area numerous times and snapper is a Jewel.,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255335-d1991157-r497778718-Snapper_Rocks-Coolangatta_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html
