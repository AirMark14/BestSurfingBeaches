ITRT,Watch Those Swells and Waves (Ehukai)),"Banzai Pipeline, one of the best-known areas on the North Shore, is noted for barreling waves and swells.  The Pipeline has two personalities so to speak. During the summer, the area is calm and is an ideal spot for swimming, snorkeling and relaxing on the beach.  However, during the winter months its waves are enormous and dangerous for the novice surfer. The waves sometimes reach 30 feet.  Several professional surfing competitions are held here in the winter months. We visited the end of March but did not see any huge swells.  The pipeline is the “Holy Grail” of riding the waves.  One of the waves is featured at the beginning of the Hawaii-Five-O television program. Surfing here is ot for the amateur so leave it to the professionals. Many surfers have lost their lives or suffered injuries when attempting to ride the pipeline waves.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r838887311-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

It is an incredible experience to sit on the beach and watch the pool of adept surfers riding enormous waves one after the other. The beach is reasonably crowded, although I'd say it is less so compared to a lot of other beaches on the island of Oahu. I found the beach to be very clean and the waters to be abundantly clear. It was a great sight to watch the sunset at this beach. One could sit here for hours on and watch the waves and the surfers! It was a little tough to find parking when we got here on a weekend evening, a little bit before sunset - so be prepared to drive a little in order to find a parking spot.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r780400535-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

al22tecc,"Great view, surf, beach.","We visited this right after new year's, although 2 weeks prior we were also at the north shore, the waves were as high.  The waves between these two visits were better, but for January 2,the waves were forecasted to be around 25 feet, lower than the 35 feet between Dec 27 and January 1.  It was still an impressive 25 feet, as the surfers were going for it, and the cameras on tripods were plenty.

The beach is also quite wide, as we went with the tide at around 1.2M high.  But because the waves were over 25 feet, the life guards on jetskis were busy.  Aside from watching over the surfers, they had to occasionally go along the beach line to call the attention of some beach goers.

We were able to park at the parking lot at the school across, although there were cars parked at the parking lot in front of the beach, and/or the roadside. Traffic was heavy, but moving.

I was able to access a local tide forecast at the TA forums for Oahu which provided the wave status, a must if you want to be impressed with the waves.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r740166387-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Kawikamf,Fabulous!,"Banzai Pipeline is less than a mile from my house. During the Winter, Pipeline breaks out the best surf in the world.  The waves are not big at the Pipe (about 10 feet, but can get to about 20 feet).  BUT it is probably the most dangerous, because the waves break in shallow waters, where if one falls of the board in the wrong way, then you will meet your maker (by slamming into the shallow reefs). I have lost two good friends at the Pipe, when it was breaking; and they were relatively good surfers.  So, enjoy the surfers, but do not attempt, unless you are a good surfer, and know how to fall from your board.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r733930381-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Great drive along the surf beaches on North Shore and can be all most impossible to park, traffic crawls on single lane with people searching for parks. Still great to see some big wave surfing.

I also saw one of the adult surfers being carried out by life guards on a body board. The poor surfer looked to have a back injury.

I’m giving this 4 stars since there is no water access except for the surfers. It is posted against swimming. There is a bath house. Parking is limited. Come before 10 am if you want parking.

chriss552016,Breathtaking Beach,"Definitely a must visit, not just to say you have been to the famous beach but to see it for yourself as it is beautiful & well worth it. When we were there the surf was huge so the surf tournament had to be postponed so unfortunately only saw 1 guy attempt to surf on our last day there. Photos don't do it justice on how high the waves get and the roads were covered in sand from the waves the day before.
Parking is very hard if it is a hot day or when surfing is on, but we went early in the morning & managed to park in the carpark. There were men sweeping & cleaning the sand of the paths & there is mats down for wheelchair access to the beach & restrooms.
Very relaxing sitting watching the waves roll in while sitting on the soft white sand.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r648495234-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html
Dave_Kukelko,"Waves, Crystal Clear Water, Sand, Sounds and Smell of Hawaii","We've been to Hawaii many times.  Always find a time to make a few visits and hang-out on pipeline beach.
If you can make pipe masters, hard to explain the experience, the crowd. Its a love in.
Also come several times when no one there, hang out a little more towards the east end with no one.
In the summer can swim. 
In the winter when calmer can still go in and boogie board, watch out for rocks.
No services, but can use public washrooms by the food trucks.
Food trucks great place to end the day and watch the sunset.
The sounds and smell of the ocean, can't wait to be back.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r647879235-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Ehukai Beach (Banzai Pipeline) is known for powerful waves that break over a sharp reef no more than a few feet from the surface. These massive tubes make this one of the most dangerous surf spots in the world and one of the venues for the Triple Crown of Surfing. One of the 10 deadliest waves in the world, Hawaii’s Banzai Pipeline is famous for its heavy swells that can reach up to 30ft, breaking over shallow, rocky coral reefs at high speeds to form barreling curls of water. Top professionals take on the waves every November in the “Vans Triple Crown”, called the “Super Bowl of surfing” by The Los Angeles Times.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r571138918-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

It was amazing to watch these top surfers navigate gigantic waves.

sgs0720,"Incredible waves, surfing, and sunsets","The Banzai Pipeline is an incredible place to watch wave after wave after wave pummel into shore. The beach is wide and sandy with lots of room to sit and be entertained by both the waves and the surfers and body boarders riding them. The Waianae Mountain Range and Kaena Point can be seen to the west, and the sun sets over the ocean near this point, offering spectacular sunset views.

We returned to the Banzai Pipeline each evening during our stay on the North Shore to watch the waves, surfers, and sunset. The waves varied in height each day, but were incredible to see each time. The sunset, too, was amazing with the variations in the clouds and the colors each day. On two occasions, the clouds lit up the sky after the sun had sunk below the horizon, and the ocean reflected the amazing light in the clouds. It was worthwhile to return many times, and our evenings spent here was one of my favorite experiences during our stay on O'ahu.

The Volcom Pipe Pro was on at Pipeline while we were in O'ahu, and we returned to the beach to watch the surf competition four of the five days it ran. The waves provided the surfers many barrels, and we saw four perfect ten point rides throughout the competition. While sitting on the beach, we had an excellent view of the surfers, and the commentators provided knowledge on the area, surfing, and the competition as they announced the wave scores and results for each heat. With the close proximity to the surfers, free admission, beach seating, and seeing athletes from around the world competing, the surf competition was a neat and unique way to see a professional sporting event.

Our time spent on the beach at Pipeline was definitely a highlight of our time on O'ahu, and I highly recommend a stop there if you visit the island.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r567035225-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

dsb62,Bonzai Pipe - Our Favourite Place to go.,"We have actually been there a number of times.  It is one of our favourites places to go on Oahu.  We are not surfers of any stature.  We definitely would not go out at pipe, and nor should most people.  Leave this to the pros.  We are just mother nature enthusiasts who love to watch the power of sea at work.  The raw beauty as the waves rise up to towering heights is incredible and then the thunderous roar rocks the shoreline as it crashes to completion.  I had dreamed about seeing the North Shore since I was a little guy watching Wide World of Sports on Saturday afternoon in rural Saskatchewan.  So this is a dream come true every time we visit.  Last year we had waves that were intense (4 times overhead)and watched as one surfers was pulled unconscious from the sea.  It was incredible to watch how the surfing community pulled together and rushed to this surfers aid.  The jet skis could not get in to pull him out because the intense wave action.   And every time they would have him on the ski he would roll off because he was unconscious.  It was a terrible feeling to be watching from shore but these guys pulled it together and brought this pro back to life.  He now surfs with a helmet as his board knocked him out.    This is a serious location.  If you can surf really really well this place may be for you, but I will tell you as we sit on the beach and watch these surfers rush into the water to paddle out.  They start 2-300 yards down the beach and before they get 100' feet offshore they have passed infront of us as they head out into the competition  The current is scary just to watch it happe.  The waves are random and the force is incredible.  We sit at the high poingt on the beach and everytime we are there we watch people get soaked and loose their belongings as the surge rushes up the beach to the very back.  It is incredible.  Then people chase their rubber sandals as the next wave rushes in.  IT IS NOT WORTH, forget your stuff be safe. 

All around just a beautiful place to enjoy and the sunsets are incredible as well.   Plenty of local food trucks around and you are very close to turtle bay if you want to head a bit further up the coast.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r564978485-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

FunOnly,Go to watch a surfing competition,"The only reason to go to Banzai Beach is to watch a surfing competition. I have been fortunate to see the best in world performing in the “pipeline”.

It is a very dangerous beach for the casual swimmer or surfer as there is a vicious undertow when the surf is up. It is not a place for beginners. Heed the red flags posted by the lifeguards!

Banzai is a very open beach with not much of interest, it is a high crime area so leave any valuables at home and all bags etc locked in the trunk of the car out of sight. There is a parking lot but this fills quickly during competitions, follow the locals for safe roadside parking.

On the last visit in February 2018 the surf was up but the conditions were not right for the waves to form the pipeline. The few surfers there only got a few unspectacular rides.

Bottom line do up to the minute research about conditions at the beach or be disappointed. Rated average unless doing to spectate at a competition",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r559688260-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

SurfChix84,Surf’s Up! Go!,"As a fan of surfing, when I found out the Volcom Pipepro Competition would be ongoing during our trip, I knew we had to spend at least a day on the North Shore. 

Winter in Hawaii brings high surf conditions. We arrived around lunch and easily found great viewing space first row on the beach. The waves were 12-14ft high and plenty of surfers were in the water. 

Winter in Hawaii also brings instable weather conditions. It was sunny and hot most of the day, then out pf the blue, we got caught in a quick storm. Luckily we were ready with rain attire. The sun came back 20 min later. 

We had our own snacks/food, but there are plenty of food trucks onsite if you get hungry. 

I would have gone back for another day had time not been an issue! Lots to do and see on the North Shore; make sure you go! 

Tip: as soon as you start seeing lots of cars on the side of the street, start looking for a spot for your car. It can get hectic especially if an international competition is on.

WillKernos,Tips for competition days,"I decided on a trip in december 2017 to see the pipeline masters and thought i'd share a few tips for those going to watch other surfing competitions. The conditons this year were very unpredictable so if your planning to see a final make sure you take the whole week before it and stay local. I stayed in Laie which is abot 15 mins drive to the pipeline and well worth staying in. On the days you want to go be prepared for all weather. It's winter so it can turn at any moment. If you can get there early, I would get there at 6am and you will be driving there with no street lights so take a map or gps. At that time you will find a spot by the side of the road (make sure your not anywhere near a taped off section) Take a packed lunch with you and pleanty of water/coffee and fruit. Then sit back and watch the worlds best surf an amazing surf break and enjoy the croud and atmosphere. Like any beach it can get hot, slip slop slap and enjoy!",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r548306225-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

A couple food trucks nearby with a specialty being Acai Ganola bowl. This was nice.

Surfing was great as the waves were good size and action was close to the beach. About 30min to 40min from Waikiki depending on traffic/day of the week.

The beach is really gorgeous.  We brought lunch and sat and watched the surfing.  We only planned to take stay for a few minutes, but found ourselves staying much longer because the surfers were so amazing to watch.

Big waves, small waves, no waves ... it's impressive to take in and terrifying to imagine the power of a big swell there.

TimDore,Great for winter surf watching,Pipeline is directly across the street from Sunset Beach Elementary School. It is very easy to drive right by it so just look for the school. This is a must see surf spot in the winter months but during the summer it is very flat. I’ve been here many times and my advice is not to go in the water unless you are a very strong swimmer. I went out on a small day just for a little body surfing and the first wave all but ripped my suit off. The surf here is incredibly powerful so listen to the lifeguards and be smart!,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r533003868-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

tcmoranau,Inspirational,"Visited in May 2016. Let me say, I am not a surfer, never have been. I do enjoy the beach, and have watched surf tournaments over thew years. For me, this was a must-do on our trip to Hawaii...and Im not sure why?! But once there, I found the entire place (beach) to be quite cathartic and surreal. As a sports lover, its one of those spots you go to where you have a 'pinch me' moment. I sat there for about an hour just watching the guys surf, taking some great photos of them, and my wife and daughter too haha!. The 7yo did get a little bored of it all, but ended up playing in the sand and water as kids do at the beach. Well worth the drive up and around the island to visit. It showcases the beauty of nature, and the natural environment the surf community reside in and partake of. I was jealous of their lifestyle.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r508617450-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

Though it was calm there were still sizable swells that could do some damage if you don't time the waves correctly and avoid being scooped up by them. The water was cool, blue and clear which allowed us to enjoy the beach even more while we were darting underneath waves and bodysurfing the shores. Pipeline is obviously a great place for surfing and seeing professional surfers along with people bogey boarding and just enjoying the water while it's calm. It was a great day and all I can really say is if you see the locals swimming and you're up to it then take a dive in the water while being safe about it.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2534322-d207510-r469991256-Banzai_Pipeline-Pupukea_Oahu_Hawaii.html

So as a non surfer what was Bells Beach like? Well it is nice to see a place that's famous even if in a sphere you don't normally swim in. But for the non surfer the appeal is that it's quite an interesting little cove and beach. It's darn near perfect in shape with cliffs surrounding in. There are multiple lookouts there where you can get good views and watch the surfers do their thing. 

There is a reasonable amount of parking and facilities and you can include checking the place out in between checking out Jan Juc Beach and Bird Rock Lookout.

gregs3071,Busy in in the quietest of times,"I visited Bell's Beach on day one of my Great Ocean Road tour which was the Winter Solstice. It was cold and foggy but the fog was not thick.

I pulled over as soon as I saw a sign saying Bell's Beach. The car park was of a decent size and there were not many cars there. A sign by a path indicated a 10 minute walk to Bell's Beach.

The path along the cliff top was quite chilly. I was wearing a beanie and a hooded jacket. I'm not one who feels the cold terribly but I needed to pull the hood over my beanie.

At the end of the path there was another, larger car park, with more cars parked and a crowd of people lining the fence. That was the Bell's Beach/Winki Pop car park.

The car park and viewing area is at the top of the cliff over looking the beach. There were somewhere between 20 to 30 surfers in the water. I had stopped 3 times at other beaches on the way and this was by far the most surfers I had seen. The surf looked pretty good.

I did not venture down to the beach itself. I took a couple of pictures from the lookout and returned back down the path to my car. I had many places to visit that day.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g261667-d589955-r800576239-Bells_Beach-Torquay_Victoria.html

AmyM1408,Bucket List.... tick.,"So my boyfriend has been raving about ticking this off the Bucket List his whole life.  We’re from Queensland and are spoilt for choice with Beaches, so of course I had to see what all the fuss was about.  
It was a very cold windy day on the first leg of the Great Ocean Road tour and the water wouldn’t have been more than 16 degrees. Those mad surfers were suited up in the full face and body wet suits getting absolutely pounded by the fresh, rough waves that break direct on to Rocks and sharp Sandstone. 
The yellow, red and black sand was interesting. It looked like it would be sharp under foot, however it was soft and not sticky.  The lookout and the view was breathtaking and best vantage point to watch the madmen.

Quite a few surfers out in the water no doubt getting the feel of the place before competition starts.

lovemakingmemories,"Beautiful beaches, amazing location","I took my daughter to Coolangatta for the weekend.  We loved the clean and breathtaking beaches and the general ambiance of the area.  If you don't like the beach, you can go across to the river and watch the dolphins playing in the water or spot the array of fish swimming close to the rocks.  There is also a lovely little inlet with a small beach so that you can swim in the calm and refreshing water.  There are plenty of places to eat and so much variety that it is hard to choose.  My daughter loved that there was a Time Zone near the local Woolies and we spend some time in there in the evening after our feast at Grilld.  The people are friendly and helpful.  We stayed at the Greenmount Resort and it was super close to everything but there are so many places to stay.  There are even a few Air bnb's to stay at which seem to be very reasonable and very close to everything.  I definitely recommend putting this place on your bucket list, in fact I am going back again in 3 weeks.  :)",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255335-d2334163-r723886773-Coolangatta_Beach-Coolangatta_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html

And when I arrived there, it turns out that it's not just Plengkung Beach, but there is also Sadengan savanna, Plengkung Beach and many other beaches. Plengkung Beach is quite clean and comfortable. And for children, they can play in the small river near the beach. The waves on the beach are quite brave so no one plays in the water, and there are also many gazebos for visitors to rest, and there are many monkeys, and as long as we don't disturb the monkeys, they won't disturb us. The downside there is not many children's games like swings or others so children get bored quickly because most visitors bring children. And also there are no signposts to indicate where the place is and how far it is. That's all my experience at Plengkung Beach.

Sholeh DS,Plengkung Beach,"Here is one of the points of the Triangle Diamond of Banyuwangi. Plengkung Beach, a beach with waves rumored to be the second largest in the world. For those of you who are not yet skilled at conquering waves, don't try it, it's better to conquer the heart of your future in-laws first.
The Terrace Limestone of Blambangan Peninsula at Plengkung Beach in the southern part of Alas Purwo National Park, on the Blambangan Peninsula, reveals light brown-colored limestone rocks with a large amount of mollusk shells and coral fragments. While sand-sized limestone (calcarenite) contains planktonic and benthic foraminifera.
This limestone is a constituent of the karst landscape in the Blambangan Peninsula dating back to the Neogene, known as the Punung Formation. The karstification process on the surface of the limestone rock forms lapies or karren structures. Abrasion on the limestone cliffs produces sea-level notches with heights between 1.5-2 m above sea level on average. In the distance, to the north, three rows of beach terraces can be observed.
The presence of these beach terraces indicates the continued tectonic uplift activity in the southern part of Java Island. Plengkung Beach in the Banyuwangi area is known for its high-layered waves, making it a very famous international surfing location. Lava beneath the limestone terrace, volcanic mountains in the north formed on the mainland.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Plengkung%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJnWsyFcGS0y0RSMfwgrmST4E

Intan Diah Pratiwi,Plengkung Beach,"Mentioning the name Plengkung or G-Land, almost everyone knows about it. Plengkung is a beach that has good waves and is suitable for surfers. Due to this uniqueness, Plengkung also hosts competitions that are attended by surfers from around the world. Surfers are challenged to conquer and enjoy the rolling waves at Plengkung. Plengkung is located within the Alas Purwo National Park area, and it takes about 3 hours to reach it from Banyuwangi city. Before reaching Plengkung, you will enter the Alas Purwo National Park, and about 5km later, you will arrive at Pancur Beach. The road from Alas Purwo National Park to Pancur is smooth asphalt that can be traveled by bicycles, motorcycles, cars, Hiace, buses, and trucks. Along the way, you will be treated to lush tree views that produce fresh air, and local residents' plantations. After reaching Pancur, you cannot go directly to Plengkung. To get to Plengkung, you have to take a Jeep provided by the Alas Purwo TN manager. The road from Pancur to Plengkung is a macadam road, and some parts are narrow, accompanied by dense trees and bushes, and interspersed with the sound of waves crashing in the distance. Why do you need to use the provided Jeep to get to Plengkung? Because, in addition to the road access being not good, there are sometimes monkeys, deer, and bulls that come out onto the road along the way. The Jeep fare starts at 250,000 IDR. Plengkung also has facilities such as gazebos, swings, helipads, and several cottages. Prepare enough food and drink supplies if you go to Plengkung, although there is also a clean and tidy food court in Pancur.

Ekspedisi kentang,Plengkung Beach,"As a country famous for having one of the longest coastlines in the world, Indonesia has many beautiful beaches. Their beauty is even popular overseas, one of which is Plengkung Beach in Banyuwangi, located in the southeastern part of Java Island. The beach, popularly known as G-Land, faces the Indian Ocean directly, so this beach has fairly large waves. The waves at Plengkung Beach are long, high, and have high speed. In addition, the waves at Plengkung Beach also roll into almost perfect wave tubes, making it a favorite among surfing enthusiasts. In 1972, a group of American surfers organized an expedition to Plengkung. This expedition was followed by 8 groups of surfers. Three of them departed with rented boats, while 5 other groups took the land route. The land group traveled until they arrived at Grajagan Village. From Grajagan, they traveled 20 kilometers to reach Plengkung by following the coastal waters using surfboards. After a tough journey and a shortage of clean water (which they collected during rain and the rainwater stuck to the boat's sail), the group using rented boats landed directly at Plengkung. Shortly after arriving, they set up a base camp to survey the surfing spots. They stayed at Plengkung for 10 days. A surfer named Mike Boyum helped establish the first surf camp at Plengkung. This surf camp was eventually taken over by a Balinese surfer named Bobby Radiasa in the late '70s and continues to this day. Inspired by the surf camp owned by Boyum/Bobby, other surf camps started opening in Plengkung. Among them are G-Land Bobby's Surf Camp which offers complete accommodations and facilities at relatively affordable rates. Additionally, there are Joyo's Surf Camp and G-Land Surf Camp.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Plengkung%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJnWsyFcGS0y0RSMfwgrmST4E

Peak season untuk surfing d pantai plengkung ini berkisar antara bulan juni-september. Saat peak season ini hotel2 d pantai plengkung penuh dengan turis mancanegara. Hotel disini cukup mahal dengan rate mengunakan dollar (usd). Tapi saat akhir tahun (low season) hotel2 dsini kosong melompong tanpa penghuni. Kebetulan saya dan teman2 mengunjungi saat libur natal.

Agung Tri Widodo,Plengkung Beach,"Pantai Plengkung Alias G-land, Tempat Berselancar Kelas Dunia Salah satu pantai di Banyuwangi yang popularitasnya sudah mendunia adalah Pantai Plengkung. Hal ini karena Pantai Plengkung yang terletak di Taman Nasional Alas Purwo ini, memiliki ombak yang sangat tinggi dan besar, sehingga banyak mengundang minat para peselancar tingkat dunia untuk menaklukkannya.  Pantai Plengkung diakui sebagai spot surfing terbaik di Asia Tenggara dan ombaknya termasuk satu dari tujuh ombak terbaik di dunia. Ombak di tempat ini sungguh besar dan konsisten merupakan hasil pengaruh arus Antartika, yang terbawa oleh Samudera Hindia. Dengan sudut teluk yang tepat, ombak yang dihasilkan adalah sempurna. Ketinggian ombaknya konon bisa mencapai 4-8 meter dengan panjang 2 km, serta memiliki formasi gelombang tujuh bersusun, sangat menantang bagi pecinta surfing untuk mencobanya.  Ombak di pantai ini dibagi menjadi 3 tingkatan yaitu Kong Waves (tinggi ombak mencapai 6-8 meter), Speedis Waves (5-6 m), dan Many Track Waves (3-4 m). Ombak tingkat terakhir (many track) biasanya digunakan para peselancar pemula untuk mengasah skill mereka.  Selain di Pantai Plengkung, ombak sebesar itu hanya ada di Hawai dan Afrika Selatan. Dan puncak kedatangan ombak terjadi pada April hingga Agustus setiap tahunnya. Di pantai  ini pernah diadakan lomba selancar internasional Quicksilver Pro Surfing Championship pada tahun '95, '96, dan '97 serta Da Hui Pro Surfing World Championship seri III tahun ‘2003. Dengan potensi yang dimilikinya, tak pelak lagi Pantai Plengkung pun dikenal sebagai surga bagi para peselancar professional.  Pantai Plengkung yang berhadapan langsung dengan Samudera Hindia dan berlokasi di timur Teluk Grajagan ini begitu digemari para peselancar yang pada umumnya berasal dari luar negeri. Tidak mengherankan jika Pantai Plengkung lebih populer di mancanegara daripada dalam negeri. Mayoritas wisatawan justru datang dari Amerika, Brasil atau Australia. Dari para peselancar asing yang mengagumi keindahan gulungan ombak di Pantai Plengkung inilah kemudian muncul sebutan G-Land bagi Pantai Plengkung. Sehingga bagi turis asing, mereka lebih mengenal G-Land daripada Pantai Plengkung.  Darimana asal-usul nama G-Land itu muncul? Di balik sebutan G-Land untuk Pantai Plengkung ternyata memiliki banyak versi. Huruf “G” pada G-Land ternyata merupakan singkatan dari beberapa hal, yaitu :  Dari kata “Grajagan” yang merupakan nama sebuah teluk, yaitu Teluk Grajagan. Diambil dari kata “Green” karena letaknya di tepi hutan tropis yang hijau. Lingkungan di sekitar Pantai Plengkung merupakan green forest, karena letaknya dikelilingi hamparan hutan pantai tropis dan hutan dataran rendah yang masih asri, maka jika dilihat dan diabadikan dalam foto dari jarak jauh, maka akan nampak berwarna kehijauan. Diambil dari kata “Great” karena ombaknya yang begitu besar, panjang dan penuh tantangan. Ada juga yang menyebutkan, Plengkung disebut G-Land karena pantainya melengkung mirip huruf G. Sebutan pantai Plengkung bagi penduduk lokal itu karena bentuk pantainya melengkung. Bila dilihat dari citra satelit, pantai ini bentuknya memang melengkung membentuk huruf G terbalik. Posisi dan letak pantainya itulah yang membuat ombak setinggi hingga 8 meter bisa terbentuk, yang membuatnya disukai para pecinta surfing.  Bagi yang hobi surfing maka G-Land atau Pantai Plengkung merupakan wisata yang wajib di kunjungi. Anda bisa mencoba belajar surfing kilat pada para mentor yang ada di sana. Namun jika anda tidak mempunyai hobi berselancarpun tetap saja pantai ini layak di kunjungi. Menyaksikan dari dekat para surfer yang sedang berselancar di tengah laut adalah sebuah pilihan yang menarik.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Plengkung%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJnWsyFcGS0y0RSMfwgrmST4E

reynovbp,Explore the nature,"Well, it tooks us more 4hrs drive to finally reach the beach known as GLand. 2.5 hours driving from Banyuwangi to arrive at the gate where you paid the pass to enter the national park. This beach one of the location in Alas purwo national part, the also have savana and other beaches that you could visit using your own car.
For the GLand its selves it still require 15 minutes to another gate where you park the car and report to jungle ranger your id and plan. And then you talk to Pak Komar as a coordinator to arrange your transportation to GLand (plengkung beach). You need to pay 250.000 idr for a car and a driver to drive and pick up for the return, they only have 6 cars where you need to wait until they retun from dropping other visitors. It takes 45mnts to arrive at the plengkung beach or you could walk for about 10km, i've seen some teenagers in group walking through the forrest.
Don,t complain about the road condition since the goverment will try to keep the part remain the same including the whole ecosystem from human interference.
Some advice : dont expect too much for the beach , it's not for kids or family visit, mostly for surfers. And ask the driver's mobile number  you need it to ensure when he will come back to pick you up.
There are some surfers camp you could rent for 450rb/person/night or 100$/Overseastourist/night.

theo1006,Walking to G-Land,"The government has left Plengkung Beach (alias Grajagan alias G-Land) in Alas Purwo National Park to private enterprise.  Three surf camps (a fourth one went broke) accommodate surfers at inflated prices - typically USD 70 to 110 for full board - after they have been shipped over from Bali.  While we would not deny these surfers their favoured sport, we do regret that the accommodation for wildlife watchers at Trianggulasi has been discontinued by the authorities.
At early morning we walked the 9 km from the Pancur checkpoint to G-Land along the road close to the beach but mostly shaded by trees.  We were rewarded by the sounds of birds and the sight of a deer family crossing the road.  Of course there were monkeys in the trees too.  At some places one can take a dip in the sea, but later in the morning the water is too low for swimming.  The surfers too then come back to shore and wait for the next high tide in the afternoon.
When we walked back later in the day we were fortunate that Mr Giran's jungle taxi overtook us.  As his car was empty he let us hop on for Rp 25,000 p.p.  If you need transport to or from G-Land, call him at mobile 081 348 757 511.
Directions: From Genteng the distance to G-Land is about 57 km, from Banyuwangi it is perhaps 10 km more.  We followed signboards “Wisata Plengkung” which led us the border of the park near Tegaldlima village. But the ticket office is 10 km further south at Pasar Anyar, and from the barrier at Pancur you have to either walk the last 9 km (two hours) or take a jungle taxi (45 minutes, Rp 250,000 irrespective of the number of passengers).
Admission: At the ticket office we paid Rp 2,500 p.p. for admission, Rp 6,000 for our car and Rp 5,000 for bringing a camera.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g317103-d3295865-r211052190-G_Land-Banyuwangi_East_Java_Java.html

Plengkung as it is known, has some of the best waves, attracting surfers from Kuta; who do the trip by fast boats.
One can see all sorts of animals in the forest from peacocks, to Deers, strange monkeys, Komodo-like lizzards, etc...

Mogeltoft,Pleasant 9 km  Cascais-Guincho Beach power walk / run / bicycle trip,"Sorry, this post is not a review of the actual beach - but it’s written to inspire you to do some nice exercise with a magnificent view all the way.

The thing is that there is a combined walking path / bicycle lane running along the coast from Cascais to Guincho Beach - 9 kilometers each way.

On the way you can:

Rent electric bikes
Rent electric kick scooters
See the famous Boca do Inferno
See the Forte de Sao Jorge
Enjoy the fresh air and brilliant views

epbwh,Guincho is a marvel!,"Can't beat this beach only 40-50 minutes from Lisbon by train/Uber (less time if you drive).  It's just far enough to avoid huge crowds in a heat wave (we went on a 95F+ day), and it is a dramatic, beautiful beach with great waves and small waves alike, pristine sand.  Only downside is there are no public restrooms (contrary to what some beach review sites say).

Discover03595301058,Paradise in medium wind. Excellent bar but bike rental was tricky. Don’t use beach cruisers. Bikes have to be back by 7.,"Unreal beach experience.  Well worth the trip!  The beach bar was excellent. Bike rental in Cascáis on our day trip from Lisbon was less than ideal, however. We didn’t understand that the bikes must be returned before 7 and had to hustle our beach cruisers 6 miles back to Cascáis to beat the clock. The bike shop staff didn’t do a good job of informing us about the situation. DONT use beach cruisers for this ride. Mountain bikes are best for the ride from Cascáis to Guincho. Umbrella rental at Guincho beach was also more expensive than expected. The wind at Guincho was perfect when we went in late June.

Roadside parking can be a problem at the weekends and during the summer.  When approaching on the coast road from Cascais, park in the Mar do Guincho restaurant car park for only €2 a day
If leaving on the coast road heading east after about 1630 at the weekend or during the summer, there is usually a long queue for the first roundabout on entering Cascais. To avoid this, drive slightly past the beach (on your left) and take the junction to the right as you approach the wooded area.

Or just sit and look and the sea, it is SO amazingly beautiful. Unforgettable sunsets guaranteed too!

JohnVandeDam,"Wild, Windswept, Waves - Wonderful!","This was easily the best beach we visited in the area. Well worth the trip from Cascais (in our case 30 mins by bike). The beach has a rugged, natural beauty that is breathtaking. It’s less easy to reach, therefore far less crowded than other beaches in the vicinity. Huge waves with some rocky areas - which creates something of a surfers paradIse. Best to travel right to the far end to avoid a tough trek across soft sand. Some shelter from the (usually strong) winds can be found beneath the furthest rocky outcrops. The restaurant above the beach is popular and serves decent grub but is considerably overpriced.

LetsGotoPortugal,The most beautiful beach on the Lisbon coast!,"The beautiful Guincho beach in Cascais can be reached from Cais de Sodre station in Lisbon by train (40 min ride) Tip 1: hire a bike near Cascais train station and go to the beach by bike, a fantastic scenic 5km bike ride along the beautiful Atlantic ocean you will not forget! Tip 2: Bar do Guincho at the very west end of the beach is a great spot for drinks & bites Tip 3: when coming by car follow the signs for Bar do Guincho, there is a big parking off the road note: when the only thing you want is sunbathing, it is very likely that this will not be the perfect beach for you (unless on a windstill day of course) as there is often lots of wind on guincho beach, hence it’s the place to be for kite surfers",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r633333962-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

And right there you have the guincho bar/ restaurant wirh an amazing view over the beach and delicious food. It is very close to Abano beach. We hiked from one beach to the other and it took us about 15-20 mins. That was fun. And we are not hikers at all. But it was a very easy trek. You should try it. This beach is worth a visit. And from there we took an uber back to the city centre. I tell you, the uber drivers in lisbon are everywhere and you don’t have to wait long to get one. It’s amazing. And it cost us max. 30€. And there is no way to reach this beach without a car. There are no trains or buses that go there.

488bjornh,Great,"The waves on these beaches a tall and fun to jump in. They can be dangerous for small kids, especially the undercurrent that can be very strong! But our kids (4 and 6) also liked to play where the waves just touched them. Teenagers and adults will like to jump in the waves a bit further out but make sure you don’t get over confident as the current (especially when the flags are red or black) can be very strong and if you get knocked by a wave at the same time (talking from personal experience from last time I was here when I was a teen) it will pull you out!

bladdamasta,"Will return, and will stay in Riyue Bay","Visited twice in two days. Had three great swims, caught plenty of waves and chilled out by the Forest Inn pool. My son had a two hour surf lesson, and caught plenty of waves. Yes, surf can be fickle, but if anywhere is going to get waves, I reckon this would be the place.

There are at least 3 surf clubs here. We went to the original (Surfing Hainan/Jalenboo/Riyue Bay Surf Club). They rent boogie boards and surf boards and provide lessons. My son had a one-on-one two hour lesson and caught waves and professed himself to be not afraid anymorevof padding for waves! Good lesson.

I would have liked to have walked to the Northern point where the best waves would be, but it wasn’t working. That also looks lovely and natural. The beachfront architecture is hotch potch and despite the huge development to the South, there is still a village vibe. There’s enough going on to stay the night. The Forest Inn looked basic but fine.

I stayed in Xinglong, but next time I’d stay in Riyue Bay. Also, water temp was good - not too hot.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r689609168-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
797pete,Disappointing,"I had heard about this place as a surf haven, and when I came there were about 5 guys attempting to surf, but the waves just weren't big enough.

Beijing_Realist,OK surf spot but not much else,"Stayed 3 nights at hotel near riyue wan in december. Had initially planned a longer stay but wind/waves/current was too strong due to offshore typhoon so left early since literally nothing else to do or eat when not surfing. the only hotel here did not have wifi in room and i couldn't watch TV either bc it was blurry and only 6 channels all in chinese. 

so the beach is like any typical beach youll find in australia or america. nothing to write home about but it was uncrowded which was nice. they are building some resort with large cranes over the ocean when i was there so that did kill the scenic beach vibe for me and it is really big so you can see it when youre sitting in the line up or really anytime you look over the horizon out to see, so that was minus. 

the main left break is a far paddle out and definitely tiring when the swells are pumping. you also need to watch out for the reefs as they are all over and under where the main surf breaks. i wore my hard bottom reef shoes and would recommend same for you unless you are experienced surfing shallow reef breaks (i do not, having mainly surfed in california where we dont have many reef breaks). soft bottom booties wouldnt protect you as these reefs felt pretty hard. first day there, i bumped into a local kid that got the underside of his foot torn up bc he was surfing barefoot. many locals do it tho but they are very experienced with this break and surfing over this particular reef. also if you are a taller surfer then the more reason to wear hard reef shoes. 

now the wave... best part, its uncrowded, just handful of locals and beginners usually. unless its pumping and/or overhead, i suspect this wave is more fattish and mellow other than the first section where it hits the shallow reef and throws a bit but then immediately mellows out some with fattish shoulder to play with so overall seems like a fun wave but i only really surfed it once and it was 3-5ft that day. you can def use a funboard or longboard here even when its pumping. they host longboard contests yearly here past couple years i think. shortboard would also work but it is a long paddle out and looked like too much work unless surf is at least 4/5 ft. fish would prob be lot of fun at 3-4ft. 

PRO: good break for more experienced surfers to practice, esp reg footers like myself can work on backhand. the wave seems rippable and is not overly fast with open face available for vertical surfing. would not recommend for beginners bc of the reef. also, the local surf shop is great and super friendly with decent selection of boards for rent. book hotel room through surf shop for better rates or stay at their hostel if solo. 

CON: reef all over and long paddle out; nothing else to do or anywhere else to go when not surfing; lack of food options; lack of public transportation (need to cab it to and from train station)

Overall: if you are here just to surf and you want to surf in china specifically, unless the swells conditions happen to be ideal when you're here, i prob wouldnt come down here just for the swell, in part, bc the other amentiies and infrastructure around the area are really lacking (and you need a wetsuit during the prime season, i.e. winter). if you havent surf traveled much then you can try riyuewan but if you have ever surfed in hawaii, taiwan, california, costa rica, or australia (esp australia which has the best and most consistent glassy surf ive ever surfed) then you may be disappointed unless you time your riyuewan just right to match the right swells (in which case, some great surf sessions can thep trump the fact that there is nothing else to do nearby)",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r450112431-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html
jaytripjaytrip,"Nice Landscape, Friendly People, but...","When we were there bad waves for surfing: no one to blame for that but hardly anything else to do. Still the surf lesson I got from the guys at surfinghainan.com was pretty good. And people spoke English there and are friendly and helpful. 100 RMB to hire a board. The village itself offers some roadside shops for tourist needs but nothing fancy, it's all very worn down and basic. No ATM, no Family Mart, no pharmacy, no... Don't expect any kind of European comfort. Difficult to find shadow to just sit on the beach. Beach not 100% clean but we've seen worse on Hainan. Water is nice.

darrong214,My first time surfing,"Stayed here two nights and two days. At one end of the beach there are some statues for the tourists to pose by. At the other end there is a rocky granite reef. I saw two men snorkeling there and there were sea urchins and crabs around. Half way along the beach there is a surf club where there is a bar and you can hire surf boards. I was there with a school group and we hired some instructors to teach us to surf. The waves were not enormous, but were great for beginners like ourselves.The water was beautiful to be in.

ramiror434,The Best Beach of China,"We went around the whole Hainan Island, and once we got to Riyue Bay, it was paradise on Earth, or at least that is if you like waves and interaction with the ocean, without the crowds. Although everyone in China rushes to Sanya, with their lake like still waters, Riyue allows you to experience a more raw, natural, authentic experience. Facilities are scarce, since it's more a place for Chinese tour groups that stop to eat and take pictures, but don't get wet. So, you have only 4 restaurants, and 3 options for sleeping. During summer the waters are calm and you can go snorkeling. From November to March, it is mostly good for surfing. The beach is calm and clean, compared to other places. There were two camels roaming.
We go as a family, the kids love it. It s the 3rd time, and am sure we ll keep going there as long as we live in China.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r342981502-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html

Moreover, there are a large number of abandoned houses nearby. They're a blight on the land. That's why I didn't come back.

JimAbroad,Not enough to be put on the world surfing map,"The left hand point is a nice fun wave and generally protected from the wind all day for round the clock sessions. A half decent length ride best for long boards unit it gets 3-4ft plus. Tides are small and have little effect. The beach has more size and power but while I was there very square with no banks to form peaks, its was just 50m shore break close outs. One day a few guys on boards were out playing it. If you plan staying a while watch for national and international competition times to avoid competing with a packs of pro surfers. I cut my trip short because of this.

A little difficult to get to unless you pay top dollar for a taxi otherwise get to Wanning and try for a bus that will take about 40-60min and could be packed with locals and school kids. Unless you are serious for a surf I would't bother as there is almost nothing else going on here. There's a large shed structure in which you'll find a surf shop (Surfing Hainan) with a surprising selection of boards to rent, and a basic restaurant that specialises in local seafood for day tripper groups of Chinese. Meat and fish dishes are on the pricey side but are OK and several staff speak OK english. After dark a few other basic places spring up.

There is really only one hotel (Hotel 21) in town for an extended stay, I couldn't find it online to book or read reviews. Rooms are reasonably priced, breakfast is rather basic and little english is spoken. A US teacher from Haikou just pitched his tent next to the surf club!

The surf may be OK if thats all you came for otherwise its just a underdeveloped empty beach.",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616021-d1859639-r185263534-Riyue_Bay-Wanning_Hainan.html

C Horn,Huntington State Beach,"We visited Huntington Beach twice, both on weekends, one was Memorial Day weekend.
The beach was busy but not crowded. Even though there were a lot of people there was plenty of space.
There were lifeguards on duty, a craft fair both times, numerous volleyball nets, bikes to rent, a paved walking/biking path, street musicians, sprinklers for washing sand off your feet, and food stands.
There are a great many restaurants on the opposite side of the road from the beach, with menus to fit different budgets, as well as some shops.
Parking Price is very widely. It is $20 parking to get into the state park, parking lots on the beach. One parking area wanted $1.50 for every 15 minutes! We will grateful we stumbled into the underground parking garage with entrance on 6th Street, one block away from the beach. We were parked there for 1 hour and 51 minutes and it cost us $3 on Memorial Day weekend.
I was surprised at how many chewed up bits of plastic there were washed up on the beach from the tide. Part of a plastic bag here, a bottle cap there... The pieces were small, but there were lots of them. That has nothing to do with Huntington Beach I am sure, rather all the beaches and the area are probably the same.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Huntington%20State%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJVbrtcKoh3YARKN871uXwqCI

Liz R,Huntington State Beach,"Born & raised in HB, I grew up playing on these beaches and loved every minute of it. But I've noticed in recent years (since the pandemic ) that the homeless population has slightly increased, which brought on more dirty restrooms and some public sitting areas were strewn with clothes or personal items from someone who was displaced and living out there on the beach. It looks like Parks and Recreation are stepping up their maintenance of all facilities by having their restrooms and all other public facilities checked and/or cleaned every few hours. Other than that, everything else was great! Clean beaches and water. Very family friendly. And beautiful sunsets!

It wasn't crowded at all the Sunday afternoon we visited. I wish the waves were a little bigger so the kiddos could better play with their boogie boards, but overall it was alright. Sand castles were built, kids were buried, and we had a great time. This is my second trip to this particular beach and my experience was the same (though less crowded this time) both times.

My only complaint would be that we didn't have a bathroom with showers bear us, just individual stalls on the outside of the building and of the 2 two showers outside, 1 was very high pressure and was slightly painful.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Huntington%20State%20Beach&query_place_id=ChIJVbrtcKoh3YARKN871uXwqCI

steven llanuse,Pe'ahi Jaws Surf Break,"This review might be a little contentious. It's not that I think this is a bad spot, it's just overhyped for most of the year. If you're not there when Peahi is breaking, don't bother.

In May 2017, there was no break (obviously), but I really wanted to see this famous spot anyway. The road conditions were terrible. Even in a light 4x4, I was concerned that any rain would trap us at the bottom of the road, unable to drive out. Tons of washouts, junked/burned cars, and a couple of grades that will be very challenging in the wet.

The problem is that the sections with the steepest grades have become extremely washed out and lumpy. You can't carry much speed, so you have to pull your way up. On road tires, you can end up in trouble with any amount of rain.

To put it in perspective, we drove nearly everywhere (including Polihale) on Kauai, which was a cake walk by comparison. In short, the view is nice, but it's not any better than the 100 other cliff views in Maui. Only go out if there is a break. There will be plenty of locals to bail you out for $20 if you get stuck.",,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSN052RTdBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x4413412ac514784d!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDR7NvE7AE%7CCgwImtWBogYQwMT50QE%7C?hl=en

Anastasia H,Pe'ahi Jaws Surf Break,"It was great off road trail.

We could have potentially go through, but the last trench was really deep.
Walk from the sign was about 15-20 minutes all the way to the bottom.  Last part of the hike( descending), was a bit steep, but nothing extreme. It’s more slippery on a clay road. The beach was empty and there were no surfers that morning, so we enjoyed absolute solitude and beauty of this spot. On our way back we already met few hikers.

Chris Kucharik (ckactormodel),Pe'ahi Jaws Surf Break,"1st Logistics -- if you have a car, stop on the paid parking on left (don't drive it) off the main road.  If you have an SUV, you can only go 1/2 way & there's really no place to park.  If you have a 4x4, you can only go about another 500ft because the ONLY vehicle that can drive this is a Hawaiian 4x4 (jacked up ground clearance + oversized super mud whumper tires).  Finally if you hike in, give yourself time and bring water (+snack)...take all your trash out, too!

2nd Time of Day & Conditions -- 40' wave is high tide, peak wind.  If you're coming any other time, you can see just as good waves in Ho'okipa.  I still had fun, but it's hard to tell size over distance w/o a reference.

On busy days there is a $10 shuttle that takes you down the old pineapple dirt road to the viewpoint. If visiting, I recommend this option. Many people walk down the dirt road, but prepare for a long, hot, dusty or muddy walk. The view from the cliff is best if you have a powerful zoom lense because the action is pretty far away. The last time I visited it had rained and the road was so muddy that many cars got stuck in the mud.

You don't need a 4x4 but it is handy. You park up the top of the hill and then you will have to walk down to the beach. Turn left and don't follow the path to the right which looks like the path to go on but you need to climb down the left side..don't slip! We got there and there was no waves at all.

Jessalyn C. :: Lyfeofjess,Peahi,"BEAUTIFUL stop. Unfortunately there wasn't that much activity going on with the waves, but it was a great stop to check out this legendary place.

BEWARE, people weren't kidding when they said that there's a dirt road. We asked the cashier in the shop before the road to Jaws and she helped us locate the place. However, she did not say how intense this road was. It felt like we went off roading - dirt road, only one lane (hope that no one is going the opposite way), holes everywhere, alot of trash, trenches.... Probably took us about 30minutes of slow driving since we were in a sedan. I would highly recommend ensuring you have a SUV when driving these roads.

Would I recommend this place? It's only worth the drive if you're a HUGE FAN of Jaws and MUST SEE the place even if the waves aren't massive. Then check it out. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend it. The drive, the sight of trash and lack of activity wasn't worth the drive.

You can see the same view in other areas.",,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Peahi&query_place_id=ChIJdTvIBpY1q34RKqFwyzGOkaQ
Travis Armstrong,Peahi,I drove back here a week ago while on vacation. First off have the proper vehicle. SUV/trucks are the ONLY way to drive back here. You can drive a regular car  however I highly recommend you park and 'walk-in' and the road (dirt) tends to 'gully' and 'washout' after any decent rainfall. Once you reach the roads end (maybe two miles at best) you come to a cliff. Watch the edge! There is some vegetation overgrowth and then just straight down to the rocks. To actually get to the beachhead you have to hike down a small single back trail probably 200'-300' in elevation thru dense rain forest. As someone who has never even held a surfboard it is a lot to ponder why someone would risk life and limb to surf such a fierce and rocky break? Whatever it's still cool to see and take pictures.

Lauri Ramírez Hidalgo,Keramas Beach,"Lovely quiet black sand beach, not heavily exploited, with shiny volcanic sand. A large amount of garbage comes from the small river that flows into the beach and from the sea. We saw some employees cleaning certain parts of the beach (only those that coincided with the resorts and restaurant). When the tide is low, it's more pleasant for bathing, although you'll be surrounded by plastics floating in the water. With the tide high, complicated. Much current and high waves. A good option for surfers‍♀️ By the way, if you plan to go there with Grab, be careful about the return if you are staying in Ubud or far from the beach. They take you there, but then no cars arrive at the beach for the return. We tried, and no driver accepted the trip.

tazawa,Keramas beach is that exotic beauty with dark kohl eyes and long shimmery jet black hair,"If u are seeking a slightly different experience from white sandy beaches, mojitos and beach club pounding loud house music, u may want to explore the keramas black beach
I was looking for something different from a the perfectly manicured gardens and palm trees swaying and keramas beach situated on the south eastern side of Bali is a delightful gem.

There's something introspective and mystical about the black beach that can only be experienced if u do a lone  beach walk,  listening to the symphony of the Indian Ocean and let your imagination reach  the far depths of the oceans trenches. You watch unrelenting waves satisfying the adrenalin  of  surfers, you observe the foamy sea water caressing every black stone that is a little piece of art from the stone carver call the Ocean. You can also spot locals flying kites, Balinese ladies  offering canang to the spirits of the seas, and a smattering of vacationers on the beautiful  beach front villas. 

Komune beach club  is a must visit, they have beautiful Nasi goreng and a good piña colada. 
Do nothing except to breath, soak up the delicious saltiness of the ocean breeze, and catch the sunrise emerging from the distant mount Agung every morning

When the sea is calm, it's possible to enter with children and elderly without problems. When it's not, the lifeguards are on duty and guide the swimmers. Many surfers can be seen along its extension. The presence of human dirt on the sand was noted, and with that, we observed dogs and numerous pigeons. This could be solved by the kiosks themselves, passing a rake daily and collecting straws, toothpicks, salt packets, among others, as, even though they provide trash cans for these, some still end up flying. There is a presence of street vendors and can collectors. On Friday morning, someone appeared every 5 minutes. On other days during the week, there were also some, but much fewer.

I travel by bus from Sao Paulo and back and it was effortless and the bus drivers help you if they realize you don't speak the local language. Also bus service dropped me at Airport doors so very easy if you do not speak Portuguese. Great little BIG town with awesome pizza spots and beach bars. My only negative is the litter around town and the lack of refuse bins for public use. Also the beach is littered with napkins and beer cups from beach users that the wind blow away.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1219730-d2429101-r239741194-Maresias_Beach-Maresias_Sao_Sebastiao_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html

PJMY,"Spectacular sunsets, with informative walking trails of indigenous culture and beliefs","My photos really do not do justice to the magnificience of this landscape and sunset. You should go and enjoy the experience for yourself. 

It being September, I'd advice you to wrap up warmly because when the cold wind blows ...  we did enjoy a bracing stroll along the boardwalk though.  There were lots of murals to surfers past, super educational plaques about the natives six seasons, sculptures and poems etc.  I thought it was very well setup.

Surfers Point is at the Northern the end of Gnarabup Beach and if you follow the road along a short way south you come to an old jetty with a pleasant coastal walking track right beside beachside cafe (White Elephant cafe) well worth a look.

It was a scenic drive going to the location. We passed by a few vineyards and specialty local stores and when we finally arrived, there were enough parking spots nearby, saving us from walking too long under the scorching mid-day sun.
We set up our small sun shade tent on a quiet spot by the shore and had a little picnic. 
We watched the giant waves and had the best view of talented surfers.

Easily walked from Prevelly and only a short distance by car from the town of Margaret River. However, for those with mobility issues, there are quite a few steps down to the beach itself, though there are some relatively sheltered benches where you can sit on the way.

mangojacks,THE POINT!!!!!!!,"If you're an ocean-loving-wave-hunting-wind-inspired appreciator of Mother Nature in all her majesty, then Surfer's Point is a must for any visitor to the South West.  

A sublimely crafted carpark atop one of Australia's most famous surf breaks, Surfer's Point is a viewing platform from which to absorb 365 different takes on where the Southern Ocean, Indian Ocean and SW corner of Australia collide.  

The panorama, north, south and west, is unprecedented.  The ocean state, always varied and inspiring.  The fact that you can park up here, at no cost, sit out on the lawn and chill and watch world class surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing and just plain spectacular natural scenery, makes Surfers Point a magnet for all the great energy in this world.  

I'm sure there must be a ley line running through that place. 

Also, the public toilets.  I don't normally comment on such things, but the Surfer's Point public toilets would have to be a contender for the world's most environmentally sensitive designed dunnies.  Someone buy the architect for those ablutions a beer please.  Bravo.

Pokemon Go characters everywhere along with a couple of stops. 

The sea was wonderful for my eyes, my ears, and my emotions. It was cold as the dickens, but, the second evening we were better prepared. 

I recommend this location. You have the option to view the sunset from your car with an unobstructed view, but, of course, I recommend braving the cold [or heat, I am sure it gets hot as hell here in summer] to see this sunset from the grassy area.

AlbanyRick,Favourite place on the coast in Prevelly,"This is an amazing place to visit, especially if the waves are big, and there are people out on the water.  Fantastic viewpoint for watching surfers, and if the wind comes up, there will be a lot of windsurfers and kitesurfers as well.  The folks who hit the water here are usually very experienced, so you'll see some high class manoeuvres, spins, and flips happening.  Very fun and amazing to watch. There are great views, but you may want to take some binoculars to get even closer to the action.  

It's also a lovely place to watch the sunset.  There's a lovely grassed area, and it's very popular place for people to chill out and relax as the day draws to a close.

Facilities here include a massive parking area, good toilets, and a gas BBQ (under a shelter).

There are stairs going down to the beach, and it's a fun place to explore and look around.  I'd recommend doing the short walk along the beach to the river mouth - you'll see reef, rock pools, and more.

You can also take a short walk from here on a paved path to the nearby River Mouth.  

The main break here at Surfers Point helped make Margaret River famous, so it's definitely a must visit if you're in the area.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1900258-d5957824-r345096243-Surfers_Point-Prevelly_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html

JimGargan_54,suburbia meets surf,"Merewether Beach has something to offer everyone irrespective of age or desire. Merewether Beach is situated at the southern end of an uninterupted stretch of golden sand commencing at Bar Beach and including Dixon Park Beach. All three beaches have surf clubs with licensed premises. To the south of Merewether Beach you will find Merewether Ocean Baths which comprises two pools. The smaller pool is intended for families with toddlers. The larger pool measures 100 x 50 metres. The area off the adjacent rock platform is suitable for the experienced snorkler and the more adventurous and confident swimmer. The baths were recently renovated and the amenities have hot (warm) showers. Merewether Beach (like Bar Beach and Dixon Park Beach) are patrolled by Council Life Guards on weekdays and Surf Life Saving Australia Life Savers on weekends. Swimming conditions can vary significantly depending upon tides and wind direction. Merewether Beach hosts ""Surfest"" , a international surfing competition, annually and is the home break for seven-times world surfing champion Mark Richards and NRL legend Andrew Johns. There is plenty of parking close to the beach, but very limited parking for the disabled. Surf House located between Merewether Beach and Merewether Ocean Baths has a variety of venues serving alcohol and meals for different budgets.

Ellemay,lovely !,"North Narrabeen is apart of Narrabeen Beach &  includes Birdwood Park and Narrabeen Lagoon located on the Northern Peninsula. If wanting a secluded private beach North Narrabeen has plenty of space & is not crowded like Manly or Dee Why. 

 Narrabeen Lakes, which is a very popular spot for families and water sports, such as rowing, fishing, boating, windsurfing, canoeing, sailing, waterskiing, and kayaking. This is a great beach for learners. The Lakes are situated around numerous reserves, which also contain Narrabeen Caravan Park, which is a Sydney icon. 

There are some excellent walking tracks around the lagoon and lakes. South Narrabeen Beach is located at the end of Clarke Street; it has a surf club with facilities. Narrabeen Beach also has a surf club with plenty of cafes and restaurants available.

North Narrabeen is famous for being one of the best surf breaks in the world, many world championship competitions are held here regularly. The reason the surf is so good is because of “Shark Alley” a deep channel and with the lagoon emptying into the sea creates a sandbar, which then produces extraordinary waves.  

By transport catch the 182 L87, L88 or L90 from Wynyard or the bus 155 or 157 from Manly. 

Plenty of facilities are available including change rooms, toilets, showers, & parking .",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2034319-d589953-r311941597-North_Narrabeen_Beach-Narrabeen_Warringah_Greater_Sydney_New_South_Wales.html

Robyn25,Take time to have a look around,"Narrabeen and North Narrabeen are approx. 40 minutes North of the CBD. You can get there by bus or car. Narrabeen sits between the beach and the shores of a lake/lagoon. At first glance it doesn't seem much but get out and walk around. The lake has a shared path all the way around that is great for an easy ride or long walk. At present (May) the lake has a family of black swans visiting. And has huge numbers of ducks and other sea bird life around and in it. You can walk over the classic concrete bridge and under some pelicans that seem to sit on the light poles, there all day. Under the bridge, people fish (I saw a guy catch a huge flathead from there) and there are swallow nests built into the foundations. There are heaps of small cafes spread through out Narrabeen that do great coffee, The Deli on Waterloo was lovely, Waterloo is the name of the street it is on. Most of the people seem friendly and bike riding is an easy way to get around here. There are farmers markets on during the day on Fridays behind the caravan park. Narrabeen has an amazing headland that  looks out to Long Reef and has a great walking track  around it. And of course it has a good surf beach and a well maintained rock pool. The caravan park is rated as one of the best in Australia but it does have a price to go with it. Just North of Narrabeen is Warriewood, which also has great cafes and a lovely little beach and headland walks. The sunrises are beautiful and the water is still warmish.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2034319-d589953-r130264067-North_Narrabeen_Beach-Narrabeen_Warringah_Greater_Sydney_New_South_Wales.html

The people working at the restaurants there are not very happy with the people that go there, kinda rude. I asked for price on two lounge chairs and umbrella, 400 pesos. I keeps walking to check out other prices and on the way I bought a coconut from another vendor. I went back to the original place to get the lounge chairs since that was the best price. The guys working there glared at us with darting eyes and said “no you can’t sit here any more because you bought something from another place.” Really you’re gonna turn down $400 pesos because I spent $70 on a coconuts?

LongKeel,Pretty beach but chair prices are a bit much.,"The beach is very beautiful and the stairs aren't that big a deal.  You don't get the killer views without a little bit of exercise.

Unfortunately the access to beach chairs/umbrellas here is a bit odd compared to other places I've been in Mexico.  Normally if you order food and drinks, an umbrella chair is no extra cost and the washrooms are then free.  Here the chair costs were 250-300 pesos.  Considering a 10-15 minute taxi ride in town is around 40-60 pesos the amount for a chair is a bit much.  If they set it at that amount but then deducted it from you food/beverage bill then maybe it would be okay, but as it is, we couldn't be bothered to go back after visiting once.  The food on offer wasn't the best the area has to offer either.  

The big plus for this beach is it is very calm for safely swimming, and the beach and water appeared to be very clean.",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r746780278-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html

Trustytraveler82,What to say but read the review,"My partner and I hired surfboards from the rental shop on the beach. The surf was quite busy out, especially at the break. In front of the break was a surf lesson with probably 10-12 people in a horizontal line taking up a huge portion of the surfable water. On my first wave I got shouted at by one of the guides saying if I came close to the lesson again he would kill me. No lie. A death threat after catching a wave. I wasn't even relatively close to the lesson considering how many people were in the water. The next time I caught a wave, again he threatened me and swore at me. Other instructors would start shouting at my partner when she began paddling for waves. Overall, it was a pretty nasty experience if you want to surf there. As for swimming, the water can be very strong and rough. A lady was hanging in the shorebreak and fell over, got pulled back and dumped back onto the beach. Myself and 5 others had to carry her from the water so she didn't get pulled back out and repeated. It is a very picturesque beach. However for these factors and the fact that there is almost no room to sit unless you're paying to sit in a lawn chair I would prefer to go elsewhere. Oh yeah one last thing.

thomg658,Wonderful beach,"We spent many hours on this playa. The water is warm, buoyant and perfect for swimming (which amounted to floating, most of the time). There are beach chairs that you can rent two at a time. I believe they offer a deal if you buy food and drinks there. I think we ordered coconuts, pina coladas and cervezas one of our stays here. 

At one point some locals found a cache of baby sea turtles that they rounded people on the playa up to see. They released the turtles on the beach and we watched as they made their way into the ocean. All free of charge. 

We went on a boat trip where the knowledgeable guide told us that Carrizalillo has a fresh water spring nearby. This is where people used to get their water supply from, years ago. 

We hope to go back here at the earliest opportunity.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r678842453-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html

The waves are bigger there but less locals. A local in the water at Playa Carrizalillo grabbed my surf shirt by the collar and said ""you broke my board are you going to pay for it?"" Also, ""give me your board because you broke my board"". After I calmly told this local I was not going to pay for either his board, nor give him mine, he said ""get out of these waters, this beach is for locals only"". I had surf lessons all week from a local guide and the first day I went alone this local surfer freaked out on me because I was on the wave he wanted to ride. Would not recommend this beach if you want to surf with your own gear or without a local guide.",1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g153373-d152482-r676419250-Playa_Carrizalillo-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html

mushaboom,Beautiful Beach - Great Memories!,"We loved this smaller beach - enjoyed it so much we went 3 days in a row (at various times)  Mornings are less busy and water is just as warm.  We rented umbrellas and chairs from the various restaurants and ate lunch or dinner there too. There are outhouses for 5 pesos at one of the restos near the main stair.  My 7 yr old had a lifejacket on most of the time as he is not a great swimmer yet.  Neither am I so it took a while for us to get used to the waves as we haven't been to many ocean beaches before!  (Waves apparently get stronger in March - whereas Nov - Feb are more calm)  If you are like us, it's better to wade right in to the water than to stand where the water comes up on the beach - as the pull of the water is surprisingly strong there.  Once you are in the water, you can ride the waves.  My husband and my son both took surf lessons on this beach.  Although I was a bit hesitant for my son, they assured me that someone would be with him the entire time and they are trained to work with kids.  They were great with him and he loved the experience.  He ended up doing another lesson the next day.  They even saw 1 of the 3 sea turtles that live near the beach during their lesson!

The beach is small but we loved it.  It’s safe to swim in the bay and while we were there, on two days, we were joined by turtles who swam very close to us.  An amazing experience.

nadine_goranove,Top 10 most beautiful beaches,"This beach has got to be up there in my top 10 most beautiful beaches I have ever come across. Maybe not ideal for anyone with a push chair, wheelchair or elderly person as you have do go down quite a few flights of stairs in order to get down to the beach. But if there is any way that you can, then it’s definately worth it! 
The water is crystal clear and a gorgeous turquoise colour. The beach looks a bit like a cove in the way that it is surrounded by cliffs, which for some reason gives it a safe feeling. There are a few little bars/ cafes where you can get something to eat if you get hungry while down there (we didn’t go to any of these so can’t comment on what they were like). 

PThe photos attached to this review really don’t do the beach any justice, it was just incredible! Water was a refreshing temperature but it does get deep fairly quickly so be a bit more careful if you’re taking children there. We would end the day there by watching the sun set and it is such a beautiful sight. Everyone just sits and enjoys/ takes it all in.

They have different restaurants with palapas, you have the option of paying for the palapa use or eat at the restaurant then you can stay without paying extra.  Because of its accessibility, it doesn't get crowded and it makes it a thing to do.  You can only get there thru a stairway...which is not that bad!  The restrooms are a trip, they have public ones, you pay 5 pesos for each visit, they are as clean as they can get!  People are very nice, friendly and accommodating.  After my surf lesson, wanted to change, there were no real dressing rooms but the gentlemen offered his storage room where he kept his boards as an alternative!

renting a chair is nice but the prices vary between the bars. one place told us $400 pesos for two people and just pay for it in food and drinks. the next day, we went to a different place and it was $200 pesos just to rent (food and drinks were separate).  you could get away without a chair and umbrella but it might be sunny and hot.

Many restaurant options. They ask you spend 200 pesos ($12.00 us) for a covered beach chair or table rental. With lunch and a few drinks it was well worth it.

Good for swimming on shallow end, surfing, boogie boarding, beach walking, picnics and more.  If you like sea glass, you can find it on Sandy Beach.  No bathrooms and shower areas.  Although there’s no restaurants on the beach, we had seen coffee shops, gift shops and restaurants along the road.  There’s a store to rent non-motorized water equipment like boogie boards by the entrance in the parking lot.",4,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d288387-r762455434-Sandy_Beach-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html

Christine2335,Quiet Small Beach,"While staying in Isla Verde my husband and I decided to spend the day checking out Rincon. It was about a two hour drive on a Friday. I had researched a few Rincon beaches to check out and Sandy Beach was one of them.  It's not advertised with signage on the road so it was hard to find.  Small parking lot, no one around.  There are houses on the beach so those occupants were around, but that's it. We were approached by a couple guys selling homemade lava cakes, which we bought for $5 each and then were stopped by a guy who ran out of gas and needed money, so we gave him some.  At this point, we took some pics on the beach, drank a few beers then moved on.  I wouldn't waste my time stopping.  We found the downtown public beach had more facilities, a restaurant and not do desolate. Don't get me wrong, we do like quiet beaches with few people like on Vieques, but this one wasn't very appealing.",3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d288387-r678611426-Sandy_Beach-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html

F8067CFkevina,Rincon beaches run the gamut from placid days to surfer juggernauts!,"I do not surf! I do love watching surfers though! Wish I had been an aficionado in my youth! I love the laid back no worries vibe in a real surfer's locale. Rincon in general gives off that vibe. The people are as friendly and helpful as any location in the Caribbean I have ever been, and I have been to quite a few!  Unfortunately there had been a storm during our visit (my GF and I) and we had several days of dangerous rip currents. When we got calm days at the end of our trip we took advantage of a glass like sea. We loved our time in Rincon and plan to return. San Juan on the other hand reminded us of rude driving like NYC!

vikcka,Great beach for learning surfing.,"The water becomes deep rather quickly but that's not a problem.

MarceloR179,"A bit strong beach, but with good and pleasant structure","The beach is beautiful, but you can't fool around, because it's strong, it has a lot of waves. There is a point where there are stones that is the best point, because the stones break the waves a little. At this point there is also a good structure for bathers, chairs and tables to sit and a menu to choose what you want on the sand. They don't charge for the table or the chair, but you have to consume something.

kaoneill7,Just magic,I have been coming to snapper ricks for 51 years and it is a beautiful spot to chill and relax. Watching the surfers and the waves crashing on the rocks is so relaxing.

There a little rock pools you can swim in as well.

Can get enough of the sunrise, morning after morning.

Endless waves...... 

Always keep an eye out for the dolphins playing around in the waves.

Also a great site when the ""surf is on"" and there are loads of surfers lined up.

This is the annual surf spot with the JBay Winter Fest where surfers from all over the world visit.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469383-d4438560-r652284854-Supertubes-Jeffreys_Bay_Eastern_Cape.html

You can go out in the morning and find people already out watching and relaxing for hours.  The view is unmatched, and the relaxed and care free.  No fighting over waves, but the locals don't exactly want to advertise to the new-comers, so the main sign has graffiti over it!  Beginners may not wish to risk the surf, but on a calm day it's fun for all.  Enough beach to grab towels and friends and relax all day!

Here at Supertubes, the land rises more sharply from the shore, affording an absolutely stunning view of the surfers catching the break,with the whole wide sweep of the bay visible on clear days. Dophin and whale sightings are commonplace from this vantage point too. 
Although tiered benches have been provided at different points along the boardwalk, there are no ablution facilites at all.

I returned after a 20 year hiatus (I now live in North America) and the wave is as perfect as it always was.  Pictures are posted (see below).  Parking can sometimes be a problem, so get there early.  No beach showers that I could see, so bring a bucket and some water bottles to rinse off.  Watch the locals enter and exit the break so you can follow their lead and please be mellow in the water.

Moomochan,"Cool Beach, Good Waves, Great Cafe","Aptly named, this beach throws up great surfing and bodyboarding, even in the middle of August. Easy to park and, if you're prepared to walk 100 yards, you get the place almost to yourself.

Our boys ( 12 and 15) spent hours bodyboarding within the guarded section of the beach but it offers miles of space - you can walk south as far as the end of the peninsula if you want.

The cafe is great too - reminded me of the Algarve 30 years ago, Good simple food and drinks, cool staff and ridiculously reasonable

A great place to soak up the sun",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608952-d207147-r516402316-Praia_de_Supertubos-Peniche_Leiria_District_Central_Portugal.html
Dpln,Beautiful!,This beach is beautiful to look at and not as busy as neighbouring Baleal but it's not as child friendly owing to the breaking waves and obvious strong current.

jonathanf168,Heavy beach break with fun but tricky waves,"I am an intermediate surfer and catch most waves easily, Supertubos is one of the more tricky ones I surfed so far. The swell comes from deeper sections of the ocean and builds up fast and steep just of the beach. However if it is not too big, the wave is great fun to ride even for my level. And of course it has the worldcup. This is a surfers beach and I would not recommend swimming here as the currents can be very strong. A friend got pulled in the rip current once - she was only rescued by the lifeguards.",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608952-d207147-r429466690-Praia_de_Supertubos-Peniche_Leiria_District_Central_Portugal.html

soulfultravelandfood,Excellent beach for surfers and non-surfers alike,"This beach has it all. The surf is top notch. There's tons of space on the sand to set up, but bring your own umbrella as they don't rent any out. It's DOG FRIENDLY, which is wonderful if you're looking for a place to take your fury friend. For those of you who don't have dog, don't worry, the dogs can't swim in the designated swim area.

I would suggest visiting the Banana Beach Bar for food and drinks. They're snacks are delicious and the vibe is laid-back and fun. They're not on tripadvisor so you'll have to walk around to find them.

Maria Frazão,Praia dos Supertubos,"It’s been awhile since I had been in Super Tubos beach in Peniche, Portugal… I must say it was a delightful day I had last week. The beach boasts of lovely sunsets that are worth the visit, and it was cold, windy, but sunny and beautiful during my stay.

One of the highlights of my visit to Super Tubos beach was taking a walk at sunset. The colors in the sky were simply breathtaking, and the view of the ocean from the beach was spectacular. It was a truly magical experience that I will always cherish. There were quite a few people surfing at the time…the sea was beautiful and the temperature wasn't bad.

Despite the cold and windy weather, I found the sound of the waves to be quite relaxing. There is something calming about the rhythmic sound of the waves crashing against the shore. It was the perfect soundtrack to my sunset walk.

Overall, I had a wonderful time at Super Tubos beach. The beach is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the beauty of Peniche.

I highly recommend this beach to anyone looking for a peaceful and serene environment to relax, unwind, and take in the breathtaking views or if you are a surfer this is a must!",,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodGRTRUp3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x3b1aea93b7d5a36d!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIChtdSEJw%7CCgwIvPLDnwYQ8O_prgM%7C?hl=en

Isaac B,Praia dos Supertubos,"I finally made it here with big expectations and was not disappointed. The waves were 6-8 feet and hollow, and they handled the North wind at the time pretty well. I was excited to catch a few views from behind the curtain and definitely paid my dues. It’s heavy stuff when breaking properly, and it seems like surfers of all skill levels are excited about this spot depending on the day, and the vibes are super chill. A few years ago, I met a Portuguese surfer from Peniche at my home break in New Jersey, welcomed him, and chatted with him.

Mark Burns,Trestles Beach,"This beach isn’t for everyone, primarily because it’s almost a half a mile walk from the parking area. But perhaps that’s one of the reasons it’s remained such an awesome beach.

The parking lot is right off the freeway. There were about 15 parking spots left in the pay lot when we arrived around 10:30 on a Saturday.  All of the free street parking was taken. Part of the walk a pathway shared with coastal bike riders. Then you veer right for a couple of hundred yards until you get to the train trestle and then the beach.

Very laid back beach. Lots of waves and plenty of surfers. The sand was not crowded at all. Saw very few children. Beautiful beach. Very laid back.

There are porta potties near the trestles and in the parking lot. If you’re walking, be aware of bikes whistling up behind you.",,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZOXBqRlFREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x9b793486bdac545e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDY9pjFQQ%7CCgwI5cPh5gUQoMCzkgE%7C?hl=en

Upper trestles was basically desolate, with 1-2 people on the entire beach, so if you're looking for somewhere quiet to spend time or look around it's definitely an option.

Summer C.,Trestles Beach,"I love to surf, but I don't surf here. I don't feel like I'm good enough haha, but I love to come down here and watch the surfers and run/walk. 

It is a beautiful beach with great surf most of the time! There are a couple different points along Trestles (besides Lower). See the picture I posted that lists the different beaches. From North to South here are the breaks: Cottons, Uppers, Lowers, Middles, Churches. The picture I posted lists the experience level needed for each spot.

I love how it takes a little bit to get down to this spot. Makes it more exclusive for locals and surfers, and harder for tourists to come down! The beach is usually never crowded, which is awesome, unless there is a contest - which attracts more people.

It is also a good beach to exercise at besides surfing. I like to walk/run the beach/trail and I see people biking the trail as well.

Robert H.,Trestles Beach,"Let's keep this between you and I alright? We don't need more people jamming the peaks.

Lower Trestles has been described as ""one-and-a-half miles of God's country"" for a reason. There are no parking lots or coastal view restaurants at this surf spot. Just you, the railroad tracks, sand and ocean. Trestles makes you feel like you've discovered a hidden gem (if you can ignore the other 50 surfers fighting for waves).

Prepare yourself for perfectly formed long lefts and rights that'll have you happy you made the 15-minute walk down the dirt trail with your gear. You won't find this spot on streaming video with a swell update (locals are tough!) but it'll make the highlight reel of and home video or competition clip. There is an annual event held here once a year by the ASP, otherwise you'll just find locals tearing it up.

Trestles is a crowded spot from trying to find parking at the Carl's Jr. to the sets. With the rest of the breaks around like Uppers, Cotton's, Church you still find yourself avoiding rails on the drop.

Still, there's a sense of magic at this break that is worth the walk, the paddle battles and dodging bobcat or deer on the trail.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente
Alton H.,Trestles Beach,"Everybody to the beach, everybody to the beach...
Probably the most crowded surf break in Southern California with wanna-bees, burn-outs, little kids and everyone in between.  But its still so worth it.  The wave is machine like and it consistently spits out incredibly fun peaks that teach you to do new maneuvers.   The level of surfing out there is really high, so scoring a set wave is going to be tough if you are not in fighting-shape.  That's ok though;  there are LOTS of waves in the vicinity, and this place picks up lots of swell in the summer time.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente

Dan Q.,Trestles Beach,"After buying some new Rainbow Sandals after many years, I decided to finally find the infamous trestles beach to go surfing.  Now for some 411.

Parking:
There is no parking lot next to the beach.  You are about half a mile away and have two options

1) State Parking Lot
3965 S El Camino Real, San Clemente, CA 92672

The first option is to park at the state lot near Carls Jr.  If you have a CA State Parking pass it will work here.  Otherwise there is a kiosk for $2/hour or $15/day

2) Street
South of the parking lot along El Camino Real and Cristianitos is street parking if you can nab some.

Getting there:
You have two walking routes:
See

https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zlPIZnZsgPFs.klHKhdfMWCQQ

1) From El Camino Real there is an opening where you can walk down into the trail.  You will walk down from a hill where you hit a fork.  You can turn right, go straight, or turn left.  You want to keep going straight, pass the restrooms, and pass the trestles map.  Keep walking and when you see train tracks, go UNDER them and you can access the beach

2) You can walk down Cristianitos Road, and then turn a left after the 5.  When you hit a fork in the road make a right and follow the same directions from above.

Some people skate or bike down to the trail.

Amenities:
+ There are no rinse off areas
+ There is a restroom by the trail leading in

What to bring:
+ Your surfboard bag
+ Water
+ Towel

Most people there just put there stuff on the beach and then head into the water.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente

Robin Z.,Trestles Beach,"How I love this place, so California-classic, so rich in surf, so effing crowded. When Lowers is firing, it's hard to find a better wave in the whole state. And it seems every young gun knows it, thanks to Surfline.com. Last time I surfed it, I was so frustrated with everybody and their mothers taking off, jockeying for position and snaking the rider, I moved my talent over a notch to Church. It's slower there, but kinder. For the young aggro, surf Nazi or traveling pro, Lowers is the spot to test your mettle. Just please, please, show some respect, a little common courtesy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJfXAOw5NpE

I still love it, even though I don't surf there anymore. It's like my ex who I still love; we had some great times together, memorable times,  but we both know we're better off apart. Such is life, such is Lowers.

Jenn L.,Trestles Beach,"World famous surf spot. If you have a mountain bike with a board rack, I'd recommend bringing that because it's a 30 minute walk (I timed it) from where you park to get to the surf spot.  

How to get there on foot:

Park by the Carls Jr/Hwy 5 overpass. It's free to park on the street but there's a paid lot too (I think it was $5)
Don't change into your wetsuit because you'll be walking a mile (some of it hilly) in it. 
Start by going through the opening in the fence, and you'll be walking on a gravely dirt road toward the ocean (go right)
The rest is pretty self explanatory - just follow the path, and you'll reach train tracks that are raised. GO UNDER THE TRACKS for your own safety.

Right where you pop out to the beach is UPPER TRESTLES.  If you walk south 10 more minutes there's LOWER TRESTLES.

Change into your wetsuit and surf on!  

TIPS: Bring water and towels.  There's no shower to rinse off and no drinking fountain.  There are a few porta potties though.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente
Christopher C.,Trestles Beach,"Had the pleasure of surfing with some great people on Sunday.  And look forward to many more great surf sessions with them.  We actually surfed Church Beach which is between San Onofre and Lower Trestles.  Parking here is restricted to Military and Government Employees and fortunately we have that covered in our Surf Club/Team.    The beach itself was very clean as would be expected.  We arrived at about 7am and found only about 10 other surfers in the water.  Throughout the morning it grew to about 30 surfers.  Still the lineup was friendly, polite, and enjoying themselves.  

The conditions were very nice, and consistent sets of 3-5 foot waves were common.  Surfers should be warned though, entry and exit from the beach is challenging due to the large rocky area for about 25 meters from the shore to the open water.  Bring and wear booties for sure here.  Also dogs must be on a leash in the camping area only.  Apparently, the fine is $500 for violation of this rule/law.  Also, the beach access is slightly changed, look online for how to enter the private camping/parking area at Church Beach, as in the past you could access from the Camp Pendleton, San Onofre Gate entrance only, but due to construction, you now follow the same entrance to San Onofre State Beach and then break off to the right and enter Camp Pendleton.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente

Kristen S.,Trestles Beach,"If you are a surfer- it's a 5 star
If you are a tourist- it's a 2 star. 

I visited Trestles as a tourist- wanting to experience the myth and the legends of the surfing beach. There's parking near Carl's and on Cristianos Way. Then there's about a half mile walk over the freeway, through the jungle, and over the train tracks. Along the way, you'll see threatening looking signs scribbled on the path ""Speak english"", ""Go back"", ""RIP"" and various lude symbols. The path has rusted out barbed wire on either side. There were threatening looking surfers too. It feels as if you're on uncharted territory or someone's claimed surfing turf. This beach is not meant for beach goers- there's no restrooms, water facilities, lifegaurd stands- nada. There's frequent helecopters from the Camp Pendelton above and  there's the San Onofre powerplant not too far away. 

Then I saw the water and I understood. The waves break really far out and you get a nice long ride. It's peaceful. There's good swells. The water looked relatively clear. If you go on a Winter's afternoon like I did on a Tuesday- you won't have as much competition for waves. The sand was pebbley and rocky in some areas- so watch out for that. Overall, go if you are a surfer and you will enjoy.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente
Bryan E.,Trestles Beach,"The only reason Lower Trestles is getting 5 Stars from me is because it's one of me favourite surfin' destinations in So Cal, besides Blacks Beach (although the 1000 mile walk down the dirty, rocky cliff sucks; the walk back is infinitely worse, after a day of surfin' and having to carry all ur gear up, I reckon they should hire some sherpas on standby there). Now back to Trestles, although today the surf @ Lower Trestles was an absolute shitter and I really didn't get much done in the water. There wasn't anything breaking, worth the paddle out. Just basically 3.5 footers an absolute joke; However, Lower Trestles will always score a solid 5 Stars, since it was the first spot I surfed, when I moved to So Cal and of course there will be far better days than today.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente

G Y.,Trestles Beach,"I've traveled around the world looking for a wave like Trestles, but there really is only one Lower Trestles. That being said, it's almost always insanely crowded. Even if this exact wave were located in Iceland, I think it'd be crowded...it's just a perfect A-frame that is super consistent, super forgiving. 

On a decent swell, the waves around trestles have this strange magic quality...something about the cobblestones, water texture and color, brings it all together. The crowds in the water kind of make it more stressful than it should be, but if you're patient and know what you're doing, you'll get some waves. Due to the competitiveness in the water, it's not a place for beginners (just walk to San O, it's a short walk down the beach and one of the world's greatest beginner zones).

It seems like surfers have kept this beach pretty clean. I guess the long walk, lack of facilities, and cobblestone beaches keep the non-surfing population low. 

I think every few years Trestles will be threatened with toll road proposals, developments, etc., but I think it'll weather all these storms. It'd be tragic if it were any less preserved.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente
andrew m.,Trestles Beach,"one of VERY few world class waves in california and therefore among the most crowded waves in the continuous united states. on a good day expect upwards of 100 bros in the lineup, with at least 20 mouth breathers scratching like hell to catch every set wave. 

the lefts are punchier but the rights are a thing of beauty. if ever a wave was shaped like a video game skate park, lowers is it. navigate the drop, drive thru your bottom turn, hit the lip, and pump/punt/float/slash all the way down the line.

8/27/10 will go down as an all time session in my book. i caught three consecutive set waves that felt like they connected all the way to middles.

Shaka B.,Trestles Beach,"dude this place is so rad - its such an epic wave and the best thing about it is that nobody really surfs here. its kind strange how such a perfect wave can be right off the freeway yet be so empty all the time, even when everywhere else is flat this place will be 1 - 2 foot and ripable, but totally empty, and its funny cause when there is some good south running the crowd at this place really thins out, I think its becuse its so hollow and you really have to know how to ride the tube in order to surf here, also its super hard to film here so most the pros are just over it when there is swell running. overall though even on the rare day when the crowd becomes a problem you will find that most guys are in the water are really forgiving and will make sure that everyone is getting their share of waves without being wave hogs themselves. this is one of those rare spots that is such a good wave but really encompasses everything that surfing is and should be, its all about respect out here and brotherhood and its really about man, board and wave, a truely soulful type of surf spot. honestly dont worry about this place, you should just roll down with your homies and paddle out. score it easy and then go to carls jr for healthy after surf grinds.",,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trestles-beach-san-clemente
