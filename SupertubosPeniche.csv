Moomochan;Cool Beach, Good Waves, Great Cafe;"Aptly named, this beach throws up great surfing and bodyboarding, even in the middle of August. Easy to park and, if you're prepared to walk 100 yards, you get the place almost to yourself.

Our boys ( 12 and 15) spent hours bodyboarding within the guarded section of the beach but it offers miles of space - you can walk south as far as the end of the peninsula if you want.

The cafe is great too - reminded me of the Algarve 30 years ago, Good simple food and drinks, cool staff and ridiculously reasonable

A great place to soak up the sun";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608952-d207147-r516402316-Praia_de_Supertubos-Peniche_Leiria_District_Central_Portugal.html
Dpln;Beautiful!;This beach is beautiful to look at and not as busy as neighbouring Baleal but it's not as child friendly owing to the breaking waves and obvious strong current. Having said that we took a 5 year old and a 7 year old and they had great fun splashing in the surf but I wouldn't want them to go out too far here.

jonathanf168;Heavy beach break with fun but tricky waves;I am an intermediate surfer and catch most waves easily, Supertubos is one of the more tricky ones I surfed so far. The swell comes from deeper sections of the ocean and builds up fast and steep just of the beach. However if it is not too big, the wave is great fun to ride even for my level. And of course it has the worldcup. This is a surfers beach and I would not recommend swimming here as the currents can be very strong. A friend got pulled in the rip current once - she was only rescued by the lifeguards.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608952-d207147-r429466690-Praia_de_Supertubos-Peniche_Leiria_District_Central_Portugal.html

soulfultravelandfood;Excellent beach for surfers and non-surfers alike;"This beach has it all. The surf is top notch. There's tons of space on the sand to set up, but bring your own umbrella as they don't rent any out. It's DOG FRIENDLY, which is wonderful if you're looking for a place to take your fury friend. For those of you who don't have dog, don't worry, the dogs can't swim in the designated swim area.

I would suggest visiting the Banana Beach Bar for food and drinks. They're snacks are delicious and the vibe is laid-back and fun. They're not on tripadvisor so you'll have to walk around to find them. It's worth it though.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608952-d207147-r226100820-Praia_de_Supertubos-Peniche_Leiria_District_Central_Portugal.html

Maria Frazão;Praia dos Supertubos;"It’s been awhile since I had been in Super Tubos beach in Peniche, Portugal… I must say it was a delightful day I had last week. The beach boasts of lovely sunsets that are worth the visit, and it was cold, windy, but sunny and beautiful during my stay.

One of the highlights of my visit to Super Tubos beach was taking a walk at sunset. The colors in the sky were simply breathtaking, and the view of the ocean from the beach was spectacular. It was a truly magical experience that I will always cherish. There were quite a few people surfing at the time…the sea was beautiful and the temperature wasn't bad.

Despite the cold and windy weather, I found the sound of the waves to be quite relaxing. There is something calming about the rhythmic sound of the waves crashing against the shore. It was the perfect soundtrack to my sunset walk.

Overall, I had a wonderful time at Super Tubos beach. The beach is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the beauty of Peniche.

I highly recommend this beach to anyone looking for a peaceful and serene environment to relax, unwind, and take in the breathtaking views or if you are a surfer this is a must!";;https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodGRTRUp3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x3b1aea93b7d5a36d!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIChtdSEJw%7CCgwIvPLDnwYQ8O_prgM%7C?hl=en

Isaac B;Praia dos Supertubos;I finally made it here with big expectations and was not disappointed. The waves were 6-8 feet and hollow, and they handled the North wind at the time pretty well. I was excited to catch a few views from behind the curtain and definitely paid my dues. It’s heavy stuff when breaking properly, and it seems like surfers of all skill levels are excited about this spot depending on the day, and the vibes are super chill. A few years ago, I met a Portuguese surfer from Peniche at my home break in New Jersey, welcomed him, and chatted with him. He said I had to go, and now I did, and the locals were just as cool... as long as you know what you're doing when it’s barreling.;;https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydEpXWVBBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x3b1aea93b7d5a36d!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC2tJWYPA%7CCgwIzuvckgYQ2KaS2gE%7C?hl=en
