Roam762195;Without nighttime structure;"We were in Maresias in May (off-season), rough sea, but very beautiful! Light, soft, and clean sand.

Especially on the first days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we found most establishments closed, leaving us to have dinner at a bakery.";3;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1219730-d2429101-r949946866-Maresias_Beach-Maresias_Sao_Sebastiao_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html

karlacseabra;First visit to Maresias;The beach has a long extension of light sand, and its grains are not so fine. The water was clear and not cold. When the sea is calm, it's possible to enter with children and elderly without problems. When it's not, the lifeguards are on duty and guide the swimmers. Many surfers can be seen along its extension. The presence of human dirt on the sand was noted, and with that, we observed dogs and numerous pigeons. This could be solved by the kiosks themselves, passing a rake daily and collecting straws, toothpicks, salt packets, among others, as, even though they provide trash cans for these, some still end up flying. There is a presence of street vendors and can collectors. On Friday morning, someone appeared every 5 minutes. On other days during the week, there were also some, but much fewer. The security impressed us, a calm place.;3;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1219730-d2429101-r945617080-Maresias_Beach-Maresias_Sao_Sebastiao_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html

raquelinyg;Don't create expectations.;I confess I expected much more from such a popular place. Too disappointing... most beaches are steep, but that's okay, as we already knew... What we didn't find in any comment, and is very important, is that except for the main avenue leading to the beach, the surroundings are horrible... narrow streets, no sidewalks... some even with sewage (a horror), the downtown is ugly and small alternating some nice and some very precarious businesses... of course, beachfront hotels and inns are great, but be careful when choosing places within the neighborhood... in the north coast there are much quieter and beautiful beaches both in terms of nature and service offerings that meet expectations.

The town is quiet during the week and on thursdays you can begin to see the sao pablo citizens getting there for the weekend.

The city has lots of stores, restaurants, hotels and nightclubs, so finding a place to stay, eat and hangout is not a problem. It is usually visited by younger travelers due to its nightlife (more interesting for young people than other close beaches).

As it is a trending beach among the northern ones in São Paulo, prices are usually higher than other locations and beaches around. But the staying is certainly enjoyable.

It is famous for their surfing contests (as the sea waves are particularly attractive to surfers) and for their nightclub Sirena.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1219730-d2429101-r312420414-Maresias_Beach-Maresias_Sao_Sebastiao_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html

Also good beach service and vendors that offer their services, without annoying you. I will love to come back and be better prepared in Brazilian Portuguese. I travel by bus from Sao Paulo and back and it was effortless and the bus drivers help you if they realize you don't speak the local language. Also bus service dropped me at Airport doors so very easy if you do not speak Portuguese. Great little BIG town with awesome pizza spots and beach bars.
