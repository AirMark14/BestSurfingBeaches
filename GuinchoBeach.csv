The thing is that there is a combined walking path / bicycle lane running along the coast from Cascais to Guincho Beach - 9 kilometers each way.

On the way you can:

Rent electric bikes
Rent electric kick scooters
See the famous Boca do Inferno
See the Forte de Sao Jorge
Enjoy the fresh air and brilliant views

epbwh;Guincho is a marvel!;Can't beat this beach only 40-50 minutes from Lisbon by train/Uber (less time if you drive).  It's just far enough to avoid huge crowds in a heat wave (we went on a 95F+ day), and it is a dramatic, beautiful beach with great waves and small waves alike, pristine sand.  Only downside is there are no public restrooms (contrary to what some beach review sites say).

Discover03595301058;Paradise in medium wind. Excellent bar but bike rental was tricky. Don’t use beach cruisers. Bikes have to be back by 7.;Unreal beach experience.  Well worth the trip!  The beach bar was excellent. Bike rental in Cascáis on our day trip from Lisbon was less than ideal, however. We didn’t understand that the bikes must be returned before 7 and had to hustle our beach cruisers 6 miles back to Cascáis to beat the clock. The bike shop staff didn’t do a good job of informing us about the situation. DONT use beach cruisers for this ride. Mountain bikes are best for the ride from Cascáis to Guincho. Umbrella rental at Guincho beach was also more expensive than expected. The wind at Guincho was perfect when we went in late June.

Roadside parking can be a problem at the weekends and during the summer.  When approaching on the coast road from Cascais, park in the Mar do Guincho restaurant car park for only €2 a day
If leaving on the coast road heading east after about 1630 at the weekend or during the summer, there is usually a long queue for the first roundabout on entering Cascais. To avoid this, drive slightly past the beach (on your left) and take the junction to the right as you approach the wooded area.  This takes you to Birre in the northern part of Cascais, and the start of the A5 motorway.";4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r738670194-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

eurydice2017;Unspoiled and beautiful;Guincho beach is truly beautiful and unspoiled, pretty much deserted out of season and a must for die hard windsurfers. The water is super cold and tricky, lots of powerful currents and big waves at times. During the season there are life guards in some of the beaches but out of season no, so if you feel adventurous and go for a swim proceed with great care. Or just sit and look and the sea, it is SO amazingly beautiful. Unforgettable sunsets guaranteed too! Big sand dunes and great walks nearby, namely one which starts roughly opposite Fortaleza do Guincho (big yellow building, old fortress) with wood paths to walk on and beautiful meandering paths providing stunning views.

JohnVandeDam;Wild, Windswept, Waves - Wonderful!;This was easily the best beach we visited in the area. Well worth the trip from Cascais (in our case 30 mins by bike). The beach has a rugged, natural beauty that is breathtaking. It’s less easy to reach, therefore far less crowded than other beaches in the vicinity. Huge waves with some rocky areas - which creates something of a surfers paradIse. Best to travel right to the far end to avoid a tough trek across soft sand. Some shelter from the (usually strong) winds can be found beneath the furthest rocky outcrops. The restaurant above the beach is popular and serves decent grub but is considerably overpriced. Other than that, we loved everything about it.;4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r698367812-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

LetsGotoPortugal;The most beautiful beach on the Lisbon coast!;The beautiful Guincho beach in Cascais can be reached from Cais de Sodre station in Lisbon by train (40 min ride) Tip 1: hire a bike near Cascais train station and go to the beach by bike, a fantastic scenic 5km bike ride along the beautiful Atlantic ocean you will not forget! Tip 2: Bar do Guincho at the very west end of the beach is a great spot for drinks & bites Tip 3: when coming by car follow the signs for Bar do Guincho, there is a big parking off the road note: when the only thing you want is sunbathing, it is very likely that this will not be the perfect beach for you (unless on a windstill day of course) as there is often lots of wind on guincho beach, hence it’s the place to be for kite surfers;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r633333962-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html
elaishaley;Pretty beach;This is a very pretty beach about 40 mins drive by car from the city centre. The sand is beautiful and the waves get stronger at high tide of course. And right there you have the guincho bar/ restaurant wirh an amazing view over the beach and delicious food. It is very close to Abano beach. We hiked from one beach to the other and it took us about 15-20 mins. That was fun. And we are not hikers at all. But it was a very easy trek. You should try it. This beach is worth a visit. And from there we took an uber back to the city centre. I tell you, the uber drivers in lisbon are everywhere and you don’t have to wait long to get one. It’s amazing. And it cost us max. 30€. And there is no way to reach this beach without a car. There are no trains or buses that go there. So take an uber or a taxi (which is more expensive though).;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r629717777-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

If you are looking for a quite beach for bathing and sunbathing this may not be the best option in the area. It is wild, exposed and full of thrill seekers. That is what makes Guincho special and worth the extra mile of travel out from Cascais. Surfing, Kitesurfing, Windsurfing are all local sports. On a less windy day it is popular with surf schools, on the really windy/wavy days you sit and watch the professionals.;4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r620612443-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

Spectacular beach, well worth a visit if just to witness kite surfers in action. The surf is always high and alas is not suitable as a beach for swimming, particularly for people with young children.
That said the journey by bike gives you the freedom to stop and admire all that is beautiful along this stretch of unspoiled coastline.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r607332507-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

georgiek982;Beautiful beach, very windy;We had a lovely stay near this beach. All sorts of water sports.. Kite surfing , wind surfing, surfing on offer. It's a bit too windy for sunbathing, unless you find a sheltered spot near the rocks at the far end of the beach. Lovely sunsets.;4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r606142903-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

robjones1967;Great spot. Get there early or prepare to be hot and bothered parking;"Great beaches. Very clean and good for swimming and surfing. Parking is free in many places, but it does get very busy. We had a tiny hire car so could put it anywhere, bigger cars were a problem. 

The sand is moderate coarseness. Made of ground up shells but pounded so much by surf the bits are very small. 
Lots of restaurants within easy reach, but all quite expensive because of location. Ie main course 25 - 59 euros. We took our own picnic. 
If you leave or arrive at the wrong time prepare to queue.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r602973096-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

Gakeitse;Cool(er) on a hot day;We consciously chose to come here when 37c was predicted in the Lisbon area. The beach is accessed by wooden steps but the last step down can be difficult to negotiate being so high above the sandy beach. Because we got there early we found a vantage point atop a little ridge of sand. We walked or sat and watched surfers come and go, some learners, some more experienced. It was reassuring to see that lots of lifeguards were keeping a watchful eye.The surf looked inviting but there's a warning sign about rip tides.;4;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r602310324-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

947magdalenal;Magdalena;Unique, magic place. Advisable to protect oneself against the wind at times, e.g. when eating or drinking or when one has sensitive ears or skin. The wind really massages the body with high quality, bright, pure crystals of sand. The surfers fly in the air and the shows are completely free. Can be cold later in the afternoon, when sun goes down and the wind still plays its whistles.;5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r597338442-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html

488bjornh;Great;"The waves on these beaches a tall and fun to jump in. They can be dangerous for small kids, especially the undercurrent that can be very strong! But our kids (4 and 6) also liked to play where the waves just touched them. Teenagers and adults will like to jump in the waves a bit further out but make sure you don’t get over confident as the current (especially when the flags are red or black) can be very strong and if you get knocked by a wave at the same time (talking from personal experience from last time I was here when I was a teen) it will pull you out!

We stayed for half an hour. The kids were having a ball so we could easily have stayed longer but needed to get to our hotel up north.";5;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189154-d197710-r593161875-Guincho_Beach-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html
